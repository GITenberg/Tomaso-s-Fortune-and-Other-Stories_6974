    <h2>
      SISTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It does not matter where it was. I do not want other people&mdash;that is
      to say, those who were around us&mdash;to recognize Sister or myself. It
      is not likely that she will see this, and I am not sure that she knows my
      name. Of course, some one may draw her attention to this paper, and she
      may remember that the name affixed to it is that which I signed at the
      foot of a document we made out together&mdash;namely, a return of deaths.
      At the foot of this paper our names stood one beneath the other&mdash;stand
      there still, perhaps, in some forgotten bundle of papers at the War
      Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only hope that she will not see this, for she might consider it a breach
      of professional etiquette; and I attach great importance to the opinion of
      this woman, whom I have only seen once in my whole life. Moreover, on that
      occasion she was subordinate to me&mdash;more or less in the position of a
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffice it to say, therefore, that it was war-time, and our trade was what
      the commercial papers call brisk. A war better remembered of the young
      than of the old, because it was, comparatively speaking, recent. The old
      fellows seem to remember the old fights better&mdash;those fights that
      were fought when their blood was still young and the vessels thereof
      unclogged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, by the way, my first campaign, but I was not new to the business
      of blood; for I am no soldier&mdash;only a doctor. My only uniform&mdash;my
      full-parade dress&mdash;is a red cross on the arm of an old blue serge
      jacket&mdash;such jacket being much stained with certain dull patches
      which are better not investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      All who have taken part in war&mdash;doing the damage or repairing it&mdash;know
      that things are not done in quite the same way when ball-cartridge is
      served out instead of blank. The correspondents are very fond of reporting
      that the behaviour of the men suggested a parade&mdash;which simile, it is
      to be presumed, was borne in upon their fantastic brains by its utter
      inapplicability. The parade may be suggested before the real work begins&mdash;when
      it is a question of marching away from the landing-stage; but after the
      work&mdash;our work&mdash;has begun, there is remarkably little
      resemblance to a review.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are served with many official papers which we never fill in, because,
      on the spur of the moment, it is apt to suggest itself that men's lives
      are more important. We misapply a vast majority of our surgical supplies,
      because the most important item is usually left behind at headquarters or
      at the seaport depot. In fact, we do many things that we should leave
      undone, and omit to do more which we are expected (officially) to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some reason&mdash;presumably the absence of better men&mdash;I was
      sent up to the front before we had been three days at work. Our hospital
      by the river was not full when I received orders to follow the flying
      column with two assistants and the appliances of a field-hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of this little nucleus sprang the largest depot for sick and wounded
      that was formed during the campaign. We were within easy reach of
      headquarters, and I was fortunately allowed a free hand. Thus our
      establishment in the desert grew daily more important, and finally
      superseded the hospital at headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a busy time, for the main column had now closed up with the first
      expeditionary force, and our troops were in touch with the enemy not forty
      miles away from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time&mdash;when the authorities learnt to cease despising
      the foe, which is a little failing in British military high places&mdash;it
      was deemed expedient to fortify us, and then, in addition to two medical
      assistants, I was allowed three Government nurses. This last piece of news
      was not hailed with so much enthusiasm as might have been expected. I am
      not in favour of bringing women anywhere near the front. They are, for
      their own sakes and for the peace of mind of others, much better left
      behind. If they are beyond a certain age they break down and have to be
      sent back at considerable trouble&mdash;that is to say, an escort and an
      ambulance cart, of which latter there are never enough. If they are below
      the climacteric&mdash;ever so little below it&mdash;they cause mischief of
      another description, and the wounded are neglected; for there is no
      passion of the human heart so cruel and selfish as love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rdquo; I said to light-hearted little Sammy
      Fitz-Warrener of the Naval Brigade, who brought me the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to hear it? Gad! I shouldn't be. The place has got a different look
      about it when there are women-folk around. They are so jolly clever in
      their ways&mdash;worth ten of your red-cross ruffians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as may be,&rdquo; I answered, breaking open the case of whisky which
      Sammy had brought up on the carriage of his machine-gun for my private
      consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was taking this machine-gun up to the front, and mighty proud he was of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clever gun,&rdquo; he called it; &ldquo;an almighty clever gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had ridden alongside of it&mdash;sitting on the top of his horse as
      sailors do&mdash;through seventy miles of desert without a halt; watching
      over it and tending it as he might have watched and tended his mother, or
      perhaps some other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! doctor,&rdquo; he exclaimed, kicking out his sturdy legs, and
      contemplating with some satisfaction the yellow hide top-boots which he
      had bought at the Army and Navy Stores. (I know the boots well, and&mdash;avoid
      them.) &ldquo;Gad! doctor, you should see that gun on the war-path. Travels as
      light as a tricycle. And when she begins to talk&mdash;my stars!
      Click-click-click-click! For all the world like a steam-launch's engine&mdash;mowing
      'em down all the time. No work for you there. It will be no use you and
      your satellites progging about with skewers for the bullet. Look at the
      other side, my boy, and you'll find the beauty has just walked through
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soda or plain?&rdquo; I asked, in parenthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soda. I don't like the flavour of dead camel. A big drink, please. I feel
      as if I were lined with sand-paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slept that night in the little shanty built of mud and roofed chiefly
      with old palm-mats, which was gracefully called the head surgeon's
      quarters. That is to say, he partook of such hospitality as I had to offer
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sammy and I had met before he had touched a rope or I a scalpel. We hailed
      from the same part of the country&mdash;down Devonshire way; and, to a
      limited extent, we knew each other's people&mdash;which little phrase has
      a vast meaning in places where men do congregate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned in pretty early&mdash;I on a hospital mattress, he in my bed;
      but Sam would not go to sleep. He would lie with his arms above his head
      (which is not an attitude of sleep) and talk about that everlasting gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dozed off to the murmur of his voice expatiating on the extreme cunning
      of the ejector, and awoke to hear details of the rifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not talk of home, as do men in books when lying by a camp-fire.
      Perhaps it was owing to the absence of that picturesque adjunct to a
      soldier's life. We talked chiefly of the clever gun; and once, just before
      he fell asleep, Sammy returned to the question of the nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the head saw-bones down there told me to tell you that he
      had got permission to send you three nurses. Treat 'em kindly, Jack, for
      my sake. Bless their hearts! They mean well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell asleep, and left me thinking of his words, and of the spirit
      which had prompted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew really nothing of this man's life, but he seemed singularly happy,
      with that happiness which only comes when daily existence has a background
      to it. He spoke habitually of women, as if he loved them all for the sake
      of one; and this not being precisely my own position, I was glad when he
      fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fort was astir next morning at four. The bugler kindly blew a blast
      into our glassless window which left no doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means all hands on deck, I take it,&rdquo; said Sam, who was one of the
      few men capable of good humour before tiffin time.
    </p>
    <p>
      By six o'clock he was ready to go. It was easy to see what sort of officer
      this cheery sailor was by the way his men worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were getting the machine-gun limbered up, Sam came back to my
      quarters, and took a hasty breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel a bit down this morning,&rdquo; he said, with a gay smile. &ldquo;Cheap&mdash;very
      cheap. I hope I am not going to funk it. It is all very well for some of
      you long-faced fellows, who don't seem to have much to live for, to fight
      for the love of fighting. I don't want to fight any man; I am too fond of
      'em all for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out after breakfast, and I gave him a leg up on to his very sorry
      horse, which he sat like a tailor or a sailor. He held the reins like
      tiller-lines, and indulged in a pleased smile at the effect of the yellow
      boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No great hand at this sort of thing,&rdquo; he said, with a nod of farewell.
      &ldquo;When the beast does anything out of the common, or begins to make heavy
      weather of it, I AM NOT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ranged up alongside his beloved gun, and gave the word of command with
      more dignity than he knew what to do with.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day I was employed in arranging quarters for the nurses. To do
      this I was forced to turn some of our most precious stores out into the
      open, covering them with a tarpaulin, and in consequence felt all the more
      assured that my chief was making a great mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock in the evening they arrived, one of the juniors having
      ridden out in the moonlight to meet them. He reported them completely
      exhausted; informed me that he had recommended them to go straight to bed;
      and was altogether more enthusiastic about the matter than I personally or
      officially cared to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed me a pencil note from my chief at headquarters, explaining that
      he had not written me a despatch because he had nothing but a &ldquo;J&rdquo; pen,
      with which instrument he could not make himself legible. It struck me that
      he was suffering from a plethora of assistance, and was anxious to reduce
      his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent my enthusiastic assistant to the nurses' quarters, with a message
      that they were not to report themselves to me until they had had a night's
      rest. Then I turned in.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight I was awakened by the orderly, and summoned to the tent of the
      officer in command. This youth's face was considerably whiter than his
      linen. He was consulting with his second in command, a boy of twenty-two
      or thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man covered with sand and blood was sitting in a hammock-chair, rubbing
      his eyes, and drinking something out of a tumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News from the front?&rdquo; I inquired without ceremony, which hindrance we had
      long since dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was not pleasant hearing. Some one mentioned the word
      &ldquo;disaster,&rdquo; and we looked at each other with hard, anxious eyes. I thought
      of the women, and almost decided to send them back before daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments a fresh man was roused out of his bed, and sent full
      gallop through the moonlight across the desert to headquarters, and the
      officer in command began to regain confidence. I think he extracted it
      from the despatch-bearer's tumbler. After all, he was not responsible for
      much. He was merely a connecting-link, a point of touch between two
      greater men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary to get my men to work at once, but I gave particular
      orders to leave the nurses undisturbed. Disaster at the front meant hard
      work at the rear. We all knew that, and endeavoured to make ready for a
      sudden rush of wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rush began before daylight. As they came in we saw to them, dressing
      their wounds and packing them as closely as possible. But the stream was
      continuous. They never stopped coming; they never gave us a moment's rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o'clock I gave orders to awaken the nurses and order them to
      prepare their quarters for the reception of the wounded. At half-past six
      an Army Hospital Corps man came to me in the ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shockin' case, sir, just come in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Officer. Gun busted, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to my quarters,&rdquo; I said, wiping my instruments on my sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes I followed, and on entering my little room the first
      thing I saw was a pair of yellow boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about the boots and the white duck trousers, and
      although I could not see the face, I knew that this was Sammy
      Fitz-Warrener come back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman&mdash;one of the nurses for whom he had pleaded&mdash;was bending
      over the bed with a sponge and a basin of tepid water. As I entered she
      turned upon me a pair of calmly horror-stricken eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;OH!&rdquo; she whispered meaningly, stepping back to let me approach. I had no
      time to notice then that she was one of those largely built women, with
      perfect skin and fair hair, who make one think of what England must have
      been before Gallic blood got to be so widely disseminated in the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please pull down that mat from the window,&rdquo; I said, indicating a
      temporary blind which I had put up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so promptly, and returned to the bedside, falling into position as
      it were, awaiting my orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bent over the bed, and I must confess that what I saw there gave me a
      thrill of horror which will come again at times so long as I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made a sign to Sister to continue her task of sponging away the mud, of
      which one ingredient was sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both eyes,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;are destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the top of the skull,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;you must not touch that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For we both knew that our task was without hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, I knew something of Fitz-Warrener's people, and I could
      not help lingering there, where I could do no good, when I knew that I was
      wanted elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his lips moved, and Sister, kneeling down on the floor, bent over
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not hear what he said, but I think she did. I saw her lips frame
      the whisper &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in reply, and over her face there swept suddenly a look
      of great tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little pause she rose and came to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fitz-Warrener of the Naval Brigade. Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never heard of him. Of course&mdash;it is quite hopeless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned to her position by the bedside, with one arm laid across his
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he began whispering again, and at intervals she answered him. It
      suddenly occurred to me that, in his unconsciousness, he was mistaking her
      for some one else, and that she, for some woman's reason, was deceiving
      him purposely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments I was sure of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried not to look; but I saw it all. I saw his poor blind hands wander
      over her throat and face, up to her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he muttered quite distinctly, with that tone of
      self-absorption which characterizes the sayings of an unconscious man.
      &ldquo;What is this silly cap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fingers wandered on over the snowy linen until they came to the
      strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aspirant to the title of gentleman, I felt like running away&mdash;many
      doctors know this feeling; as a doctor, I could only stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers fumbled with the strings. Still Sister bent over the bed.
      Perhaps she bent an inch or two nearer. One hand was beneath his neck,
      supporting the poor shattered head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly drew off the cap, and his fingers crept lovingly over the soft
      fair hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marny,&rdquo; he said, quite clearly, &ldquo;you've done your hair up, and you're
      nothing but a little girl, you know&mdash;nothing but a little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not help watching his fingers, and yet I felt like a man
      committing sacrilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I left you,&rdquo; said the brainless voice, &ldquo;you wore it down your back.
      You were a little girl&mdash;you are a little girl now.&rdquo; And he slowly
      drew a hairpin out.
    </p>
    <p>
      One long lock fell curling to her shoulder. She never looked up, never
      noticed me, but knelt there like a ministering angel&mdash;personating for
      a time a girl whom we had never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little girl,&rdquo; he added, with a low laugh, and drew out another
      hairpin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments all her hair was about her shoulders. I had never thought
      that she might be carrying such glory quietly hidden beneath the simple
      nurse's cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;that is better.&rdquo; And he let all the
      hairpins fall on the coverlet. &ldquo;Now you are my own Marny,&rdquo; he murmured.
      &ldquo;Are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated one moment. &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;I am your own
      Marny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her disengaged hand she stroked his blanching cheek. There was a
      certain science about her touch, as if she had once known something of
      these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lovingly and slowly the smoke-grimed fingers passed over the wonderful
      hair, smoothing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he grew more daring. He touched her eyes, her gentle cheeks, the
      quiet, strong lips. He slipped to her shoulder, and over the soft folds of
      her black dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been gardening?&rdquo; he asked, coming to the bib of her nursing apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was marvellous how the brain, which was laid open to the day, retained
      the consciousness of one subject so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;dear,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old apron is all wet!&rdquo; he said reproachfully, touching her breast
      where the blood&mdash;his own blood&mdash;was slowly drying.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand passed on, and as it touched her, I saw her eyes soften into such
      a wonderful tenderness that I felt as if I were looking on a part of
      Sister's life which was sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a little movement as if to draw back, then she resolutely held her
      position. But her eyes were dull with a new pain. I wonder&mdash;I have
      wondered ever since&mdash;what memories that poor senseless wreck of a man
      was arousing in the woman's heart by his wandering touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Marny. It was not TOO hard waiting for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right now, Marny. The bad part is all past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marny, you remember&mdash;the night&mdash;I left&mdash;Marny&mdash;I want&mdash;no&mdash;no,
      your LIPS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knelt suddenly, and slipped my hand within his shirt, for I saw
      something in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sister's lips touched his I felt his heart give a great bound within
      his breast, and then it was still. When she lifted her face it was as pale
      as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must say that I felt like crying&mdash;a feeling which had not come to
      me for twenty years. I busied myself purposely with the dead man, and when
      I had finished my task I turned, and found Sister filling in the papers&mdash;her
      cap neatly tied, her golden hair hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      I signed the certificate, placing my name beneath hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we stood. Our eyes met, and&mdash;we said nothing. She moved
      towards the door, and I held it open while she passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later I received orders from the officer in command to send the
      nurses back to headquarters. Our men were falling back before the enemy.

    <h2>
      A SMALL WORLD
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Thine were the calming eyes
      That round my pinnace could have stilled the sea,
      And drawn thy voyager home, and bid him be
      Pure with their pureness, with their wisdom wise,
      Merged in their light, and greatly lost in thee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was midday at the monastery of Montserrat, and a monk, walking in the
      garden, turned and paused in his meditative promenade to listen to an
      unwonted noise. The silence of this sacred height is so intense that many
      cannot sleep at night for the hunger of a sound. There is no running water
      except the fountain in the patio. There are no birds to tell of spring and
      morning. There are no trees for the cool night winds to stir, nothing but
      eternal rock and the ancient building so closely associated with the life
      of Ignatius de Loyola. The valley, a sheer three thousand feet below, is
      thinly enough populated, though a great river and the line of railway from
      Manresa to Barcelona run through it. So clear is the atmosphere that at
      the great distance the contemplative denizens of the monastery may count
      the number of the railway carriages, while no sound of the train, or
      indeed of any life in the valley, reaches their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the monk heard was disturbing, and he hurried to the corner of the
      garden, from whence a view of the winding road may be obtained. Floating
      on the wind came the sound, as from another world, of shouting, and the
      hollow rumble of wheels. The holy man peered down into the valley, and
      soon verified his fears. It was the diligencia, which had quitted the
      monastery a short hour ago, that flew down the hill to inevitable
      destruction. Once before in the recollection of the watcher the mules had
      run away, rushing down to their death, and carrying with them across that
      frontier the lives of seven passengers, devout persons, who, having
      performed the pilgrimage to the shrine of our Lady of Montserrat, had
      doubtless received their reward. The monk crossed himself, but, being
      human, forgot alike to pray and to call his brethren to witness the scene.
      It was like looking at a play from a very high gallery. The miniature
      diligencia on the toy road far below swayed from the bank of the highway
      to the verge&mdash;the four mules stretched out at a gallop, as in a
      picture. The shouts dimly heard at the monastery had the effect they were
      intended to create, for the monk could see the carters and muleteers draw
      aside to let the living avalanche go past.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were but two men on the box-seat of the diligencia&mdash;the driver
      and a passenger seated by his side. The monk recollected that this
      passenger had passed two days at Montserrat, inscribing himself in the
      visitors' book as Matthew S. Whittaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to take the reins when your arms are cramped,&rdquo; this passenger
      was saying at that precise moment, &ldquo;but I do not know the road, and I
      cannot drive so well as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished with a curt laugh, and, holding on with both hands, he turned
      and looked at his companion. He was not afraid, and death assuredly stared
      him in the face at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for that, at all events,&rdquo; returned the driver, handling his reins
      with a steady skill. Then he fell to cursing the mules. As he rounded each
      corner of the winding road, he gave a derisive shout of triumph; as he
      safely passed a cart, he gave voice to a yell of defiance. He went to his
      death&mdash;if death awaited him&mdash;with a fine spirit, with a light in
      his eyes and the blood in his tanned cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at his side could perhaps have saved himself by a leap which
      might, with good fortune, have resulted in nothing more serious than a
      broken limb. As he had been invited by the driver to take this leap and
      had curtly declined, it is worth while to pause and give particulars of
      this passenger on the runaway diligencia. He was a slightly built man,
      dressed in the ordinary dark clothes and soft black felt hat of the middle
      class Spaniard. His face was brown and sun-dried, with deep lines drawn
      downwards from the nose to the lips in such a manner that cynicism and a
      mildly protesting tolerance were contending for mastery in an otherwise
      studiously inexpressive countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Excellency does not blame me for this?&rdquo; the driver jerked out, as he
      hauled round a corner with a sort of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend,&rdquo; replied the American; and he broke off suddenly to curve
      his two hands around his lips and give forth a warning shout in a clear
      tenor that rang down the valley like a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A muleteer leading a heavily laden animal drew his beast into the ditch,
      and leapt into the middle of the road. He stepped nimbly aside and sprang
      at the leading mule, but was rolled into the ditch like an old hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an old torero,&rdquo; shouted the driver. &ldquo;Bravo, bravo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they flew on, Whittaker turned in his seat and caught a glimpse of the
      man standing in the middle of the road, with arms spread out in an
      attitude of apology and deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the driver, &ldquo;we shall not pass these. Now leap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other, and gave his warning shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below them on the spiral road two heavy carts were slowly mounting. These
      were the long country carts used for the carriage of wine-casks, heavily
      laden with barrels for the monastery. The drivers, looking up, saw in a
      moment what to expect, and ran to the head of their long teams of eight
      mules, but all concerned knew in a flash of thought that they could not
      pull aside in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leap, in the name of a saint!&rdquo; cried the driver, clenching his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker made no answer. But he cleared his feet and sat forward, his
      keen face and narrow eyes alert to seize any chance of life. The maddened
      mules rushed on, seeking to free themselves from the swaying destroyer on
      their heels. The leaders swung round the corner, but refused to obey the
      reins when they caught sight of the cart in front. The brakes had long
      ceased to act; the wooden blocks were charred as by fire. The two heavier
      mules at the pole made a terrified but intelligent attempt to check the
      pace, and the weighty vehicle skidded sideways across the road, shuddering
      and rattling as it went. It poised for a moment on the edge of the slope,
      while the mules threw themselves into their collars&mdash;their
      intelligence seeming to rise at this moment to a human height. Then the
      great vehicle turned slowly over, and at the same moment Whittaker and the
      driver leapt into the tangle of heels and harness. One of the leaders
      swung right out in mid-air with flying legs, and mules and diligencia
      rolled over and over down the steep in a cloud of dust and stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Matthew S. Whittaker recovered consciousness, he found himself in a
      richly furnished bedroom. He woke as if from sleep, with his senses fully
      alert, and began at once to take an interest in a conversation of which he
      had been conscious in the form of a faint murmur for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A broken arm, my child, and nothing more, so far as I can tell at
      present,&rdquo; were the first comprehensible words. Whittaker tried to move his
      left arm, and winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other man?&rdquo; inquired a woman's voice in Spanish, but with an
      accent which the listener recognised at once. This was an Englishwoman
      speaking Spanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the other man is dead. Poor Mogul! He was always civil and
      God-fearing. He has driven the diligencia up to us for nearly twenty
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker turned his head, and winced again. The speaker was a monk&mdash;fat
      and good-natured&mdash;one of the few now left in the great house on
      Montserrat. His interlocutor was a woman not more than thirty, with brown
      hair that gleamed in the sunlight, and a fresh, thoughtful face. Her
      attitude was somewhat independent, her manner indicated a self-reliant
      spirit. This was a woman who would probably make mistakes in life, but
      these would not be the errors of omission. She was a prototype of a sex
      and an age which err in advancing too quickly, and in holding that
      everything which is old-fashioned must necessarily be foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker lay quite still and watched these two, while the deep-drawn
      lines around his lips indicated a decided sense of amusement. He was in
      pain, but that was no new condition to a man whose spirit had ever been
      robuster than his body. He had, at all events, not been killed, and his
      last recollection had been the effort to face death. So he lay with a
      twisted smile on his lips listening to Brother Lucas, who, sad old monk
      that he was, took infinite pleasure in glorifying to the young lady his
      own action in causing the monastery cart to be brought out, and in driving
      down the slope at a breakneck pace to place his medical knowledge at the
      disposal of such as might require it. He bowed in a portly way, and
      indicated with a very worldly politeness that he himself was, in fact, at
      the disposal of the Senorita.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not always a monk&mdash;I began life as a doctor,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his companion looked at him with speculative, clever eyes, scenting
      afar off, with the quickness of her kind, the usual little romance&mdash;the
      everlasting woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Whittaker in the alcove coughed with discretion. Both turned and
      hurried towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has recovered his senses,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk had, however, not laid aside all the things of this world. He
      remembered the little ceremonies appertaining to the profession which he
      had once practised. He waived aside the girl, and stooped over the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand what I say&mdash;you see me?&rdquo; he inquired in a soothing
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most assuredly,&rdquo; replied Whittaker, coolly. &ldquo;Most assuredly, my father.
      And I do not think there is much the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Saints, but you go too quickly,&rdquo; laughed the monk. &ldquo;You will be
      wanting next to get up and walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not mind trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is good! Then you will soon be well. Senorita, we shall have no
      trouble with this patient. This, Senor, is the Senorita Cheyne; in whose
      house you find yourself, and to whom your thanks are due.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker turned in bed to thank her; but instead of speaking, he quietly
      fainted. He came to his senses again, and found that it was evening. The
      windows of his room were open, and he could see across the valley the
      brown hills of Catalonia, faintly tinged with pink. A nursing sister in
      her dark blue dress and white winged cap was seated at the open window,
      gazing reflectively across the valley. There was an odour of violets in
      the room. A fitful breeze stirred the lace curtains. Whittaker perceived
      his own travel-worn portmanteau lying half unpacked on a side table. It
      seemed that some one had opened it to seek the few necessaries of the
      moment. He noted with a feeling of helplessness that his simple travelling
      accessories had been neatly arranged on the dressing-table. A clean
      handkerchief lay on the table at the bedside. The wounded man became
      conscious of a feeling that he had lost some of the solitary liberty which
      had hitherto been his. It seemed that he had been picked up on the road
      helpless and insensible by some one with the will and power to take entire
      charge of him. The feeling was so new to this adventurer that he lay still
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the nun rose and came quietly towards him, disclosing within the
      halo of her snowy cap a gentle pink-and-white face wrinkled by the passage
      of uneventful years. She nodded cheerfully on seeing that his eyes were
      open, and gave him some soup which was warming on a spirit lamp in
      readiness for his return to consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell the Senorita,&rdquo; she said, and noiselessly quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later Miss Cheyne came in with a pleasant frou-frou of silk, and
      Whittaker wondered for whom she had dressed so carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she said in English, with an ease of manner which is of
      this generation, &ldquo;that I had succoured a countryman. You were literally
      thrown at my gate. But the doctor, who has just left, confirms the opinion
      of Brother Lucas that you are not seriously hurt. A broken fore-arm and a
      severe shake, they say&mdash;to be cured by complete rest, which you will
      be able to enjoy here. For there is no one in the house but my aunt, Mrs.
      Dorchester, and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the bedside, looking down at him with her capable, managing
      air. Whittaker now knew the source of that sense of being &ldquo;taken in and
      done for,&rdquo; of which he had become conscious the moment his senses returned
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say,&rdquo; she went on, with a decisiveness which was probably an
      accentuation of her usual attitude, inspired by the necessity of sparing
      the patient the exertion of an explanation or an apology&mdash;&ldquo;they say,
      however, that you are not naturally a very strong man, and that you have
      tried your constitution in the past, so that greater care is required than
      would otherwise be necessary in such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the brown face and sinewy neck, the hollow cheeks, the lean
      hands (&ldquo;all wires,&rdquo; as she decided in her own prompt mind), and her clear
      eyes were alight with a speculation as to what the past had been in which
      this man had tried his constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have led a rough life,&rdquo; explained Whittaker; and Miss Cheyne nodded her
      head in a manner indicative of the fact that she divined as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a Spaniard,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have lived in the Spanish colonies, however&mdash;the last few
      years&mdash;since the troubles began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne nodded again without surprise. She had gone about the world,
      with those clear eyes of hers very wide open, and was probably aware that
      in those parts where, as Whittaker gracefully put it, &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; are, such
      men as this are usually to be found. For it is not the large men who make
      a stir in the world. These usually sit at home and love a life of ease. It
      is even said that they take to novel-writing and other sedentary
      occupations. And in the forefront, where things are stirring and history
      is to be manufactured, are found the small and the frail, such as Matthew
      S. Whittaker, who, in addition to the battles of progress, have to contend
      personally against constitutional delicacy, nervous depression, and
      disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne kept silence for a few moments, and, during the pause, turned
      at the sound of horses' feet on the gravel below the windows. She seemed
      to have been expecting an arrival, and Whittaker noticed a sudden
      brightening of the eyes, an almost imperceptible movement of the
      shoulders, as if Miss Cheyne was drawing herself up. The American quickly
      reflected that the somewhat elaborate &ldquo;toilette&rdquo; was unusual, and
      connected it with the expected visitor. He was not surprised when, with a
      polite assurance that he had only to ask for anything he might require,
      she turned and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker now remembered having been told by the voluble driver of the
      diligencia the history of a certain English Senorita who, having inherited
      property from a forgotten uncle, had come to live in her &ldquo;possession&rdquo; on
      the mountain side. He further recollected that the house had been pointed
      out to him&mdash;a long, low dwelling of the dull red stone quarried in
      this part of Catalonia. Being of an observant habit, he remembered that
      the house was overgrown by a huge wisteria, and faced eastward. He turned
      his head painfully, and now saw that his windows were surrounded by mauve
      fronds of wisteria. His room was, therefore, situated in the front of the
      house. There was, he recollected, a verandah below his windows, and he
      wondered whether Miss Cheyne received her visitors there in the cool of
      the afternoon. He listened half-sleepily, and heard the horse depart, led
      away by a servant. There followed the murmur of a conversation, between
      two persons only, below his window. So far as he could gather from the
      tones, for the words were inaudible, they were spoken in English. And thus
      he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few days Whittaker made good progress, and fully enjoyed
      the quiet prescribed to him by the doctors. The one event of the day was
      Miss Cheyne's visit, to which he soon learnt to look forward. He had,
      during an adventurous life, had little to do with women, and Miss Cheyne
      soon convinced him of the fact that many qualities&mdash;such as
      independence, courage, and energy&mdash;were not, as he had hitherto
      imagined, the monopoly of men alone. But the interest thus aroused did not
      seem to be mutual. Miss Cheyne was kind and quick to divine his wants or
      thoughts; but her visits did not grow longer day by day as, day by day,
      Whittaker wished they would. Daily, moreover, the visitor arrived on
      horseback, and the murmured conversation in the verandah duly followed. A
      few weeks earlier Whittaker had made the voyage across to the island of
      Majorca, to visit an old companion-in-arms there, and offer him a
      magnificent inducement to return to active service. That comrade had
      smilingly answered that he held cards of another suite. Miss Cheyne
      likewise appeared to hold another suite, and the American felt vaguely
      that the dealer of life's cards seemed somehow to have passed him by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He daily urged the young doctor to allow him to leave his bed, &ldquo;if only,&rdquo;
       he pleaded with his twisted smile, &ldquo;to sit in a chair by the window.&rdquo; At
      last he gained his point, and sat, watch in hand, awaiting the arrival of
      Miss Cheyne's daily visitor. To the end of his life Matthew Whittaker
      believed that some instinct guided him at this time. He had only spoken
      with his nurse and the doctor, and had refrained from making inquiries of
      either respecting the lady whose hospitality he enjoyed. He had now
      carefully recalled all that the dead driver of the diligencia had told
      him, and had dismissed half of it as mere gossip. Beyond the fact that
      Miss Cheyne's aunt, Mrs. Dorchester, acted as her companion, he knew
      nothing. But he had surmised, from remarks dropped by the young lady
      herself, that her mother had been a Spaniard; hence the uncle from whom
      she had inherited this estate. He also had reason to believe that Miss
      Cheyne's mother had brought her up in the older faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected on these matters, and smiled half cynically at the magnitude
      of his own interest in Miss Cheyne as he sat at the open window. He had
      not long to wait before the clatter of horse's feet on the hard road
      became audible. The house stood back from the high-road in the midst of
      terraced olive groves, and was entirely surrounded by a grove of cypress
      and ilex trees. The visitor, whose advent was doubtless awaited with as
      keen an impatience by another within the red stone house, now leisurely
      approached beneath the avenue of evergreen oak. Whittaker got painfully
      upon his feet, and stood, half concealed by the curtain. He was conscious
      of a singular lack of surprise when he recognized the face of the horseman
      as one that he had already seen, though, when he came in a flash of
      thought to reflect upon it, this among all he knew was the last face that
      he could have expected to see in that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down quite coolly and mechanically, thinking and acting as men
      think and act, by instinct, in a crisis. He seemed to be obeying some
      pre-ordained plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horseman was dark and clean-shaven&mdash;the happy possessor of one of
      those handsome Andalusian faces which are in themselves a passport in a
      world that in its old age still persists in judging by appearance.
      Whittaker scrupulously withdrew from the window. He had no desire to
      overhear their conversation. But his eyes were fierce with a sudden anger.
      The very attitude of the new-comer&mdash;his respectful, and yet
      patronizing, manner of removing his hat&mdash;clearly showed that he was a
      lover, perhaps a favoured one. And the American, who, with all his
      knowledge of the world, knew so little of women, stood in the middle of
      the room wrapt in thought. It seemed hardly possible that a woman of Miss
      Cheyne's intelligence, a woman no longer in the first flush of girlhood,
      should fail to perceive the obvious. He did not know that so far as her
      vanity is concerned a woman does not grow older, by the passage of years,
      but younger&mdash;that she will often, for the sake of a little
      admiration, accept the careless patronage of a man, knowing well that his
      one good quality is the skill with which he flatters her. He was not aware
      that Miss Cheyne was distinctly handicapped, and that her judgment was
      warped by the fact that she had by some chance or another reached to years
      of discretion without ever having had a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker was not an impulsive man, although as prompt in action as he was
      quick to make a decision. He was a citizen of that new country where an
      old chivalry still survives. His sense of chivalry was also intensified by
      the fact, already stated, that he knew but little of that sex which is at
      the moment making a superficial stir in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the harm is done, a day more will make it no worse, I reckon,&rdquo; he said
      reflectively. He would not listen to what they said, though he could have
      heard easily enough, had he so desired. He watched Miss Cheyne and her
      lover, however, as they slowly walked the length of the garden&mdash;she,
      holding a fan in the Spanish fashion, to shield her face from the setting
      sun; the man, hat in hand, and carrying himself with a sort of respectful
      grandeur, characteristic of his race. At the end of the garden they
      paused, and Whittaker smiled cynically at the sight of the man's dark eyes
      as he looked at Miss Cheyne. He was apparently asking for something, and
      she at last yielded, giving him slowly, almost shyly, a few violets that
      she had worn in her belt. Whittaker gave a curt laugh, but his eyes were
      by no means mirthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening Miss Cheyne came into his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a visitor,&rdquo; he said, in the course of their usual
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered frankly; and Whittaker reflected that, at all events,
      she knew her own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing further upon that subject, but later he referred to a
      topic which he had hitherto scrupulously avoided. He had passed his life
      among a class of men who were not in the habit of growing voluble
      respecting themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you take me for an Englishman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am not. I am an
      American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You have no accent,&rdquo; replied Miss Cheyne; and, despite that other
      suite of cards that she held, she looked at him speculatively. She was, in
      a way, interested in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived abroad a great deal, the last few years in Cuba.&rdquo; And his
      quick eyes flashed across her face. She was not interested in Cuba, at all
      events, and evidently knew nothing of that distressful island. When she
      left him, he stood looking at the closed door reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be for to-morrow,&rdquo; he said to himself, with his short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the doctor paid his usual visit, and Whittaker handed him
      an envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving this evening,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I shall leave in your debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, who was a young man and a Spanish gentleman, slipped the
      envelope into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The debt is mine. You are not fit to be moved yet;
      but it is as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you order me a carriage to be here at five o'clock this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And omit to mention it to my hostess. You understand my position here,
      and my fear of outstaying a most courteous welcome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the doctor, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o'clock Whittaker had packed his portmanteau. He took up his
      position at the window and waited. Before long he heard the sound of a
      horse's feet. Miss Cheyne's visitor presently appeared, and swung off his
      hat with the usual deferential pride. The horse was led away. The usual
      murmured conversation followed. Whittaker rose and walked to the door. He
      paused on the threshold, and looked slowly round the room as if conscious
      then that the moment was to be one of the indelible memories of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the stairs he needed the support of the balustrade. When he reached the
      verandah his face was colourless, with shining eyes. Miss Cheyne was
      sitting with her back turned towards him, but her companion saw him at
      once and rose to his feet, lifting his hat with a politely inquiring air.
      From long habit acquired among a naturally polite people, Whittaker
      returned the salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not recognise me, Senor?&rdquo; he said, in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other shook his head, still polite and rather surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was known in Cuba by the name of Mateo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniard's handsome, sunburnt face slowly turned to the colour of
      ashes. His eyes looked into Whittaker's, not in anger, but with a pathetic
      mingling of reproach and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; said Miss Cheyne, alert, and rising,
      characteristically, to the emergency of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker bit his lip and looked at the Spaniard, who seemed to be dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better go,&rdquo; he said, almost gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; repeated Miss Cheyne, looking from one to
      the other. Then she turned to Whittaker, by what instinct she never knew.
      &ldquo;Who is this gentleman?&rdquo; she asked, angrily. &ldquo;What have you against him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whittaker, still biting his lip, looked hard at her. Then he made a
      gesture with his two hands, which was more eloquent than a thousand words;
      for it seemed to convey to the two persons who breathlessly awaited his
      words that he found himself in a position that was intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him in Cuba,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I have nothing against him, Miss
      Cheyne; but the man is a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>

                    *          *          *

    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Senorita&mdash;I have made it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proprietor of the Venta of the Moor's Mill set down upon the table in
      front of the inn a cracked dish containing an omelette. It was not a bad
      omelette, though not quite innocent of wood-ash, perhaps, and somewhat
      ill-shapen. The man laughed gaily and drew himself up. So handsome a man
      could surely be forgiven a broken omelette and some charcoal, if only for
      the sake of his gay blue eyes, his curling brown hair, and his
      devil-may-care air of prosperity. He looked at the Senorita and laughed in
      the manner of a man who had never yet failed to &ldquo;get on&rdquo; with women. He
      folded his arms with fine, open gestures, and stood looking with approving
      nods upon his own handiwork. He was without the shadow of the trailing
      vine which runs riot over bamboo trelliswork in front of the Venta,
      affording a much needed shade in this the sunniest spot in all Majorca,
      and the fierce sun beat down upon his face, which was tanned a deep,
      healthy brown. He was clad almost in white; for his trousers were of
      canvas, his shirt of spotless linen. Round his waist he wore the usual
      Spanish faja or bright red cloth. He was consciously picturesque, and
      withal so natural, so good-natured, so astonishingly optimistic, as to be
      quite inoffensive in his child-like conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Venta of the Moor's Mill stands, as many know, at the northern end of
      the Val D'Erraha, looking down upon the broader valley, through which runs
      the high road from Palma to Valdemosa. The city of Palma, itself, is only
      a few miles away, for such as know the mountain path. Few customers come
      this way, and the actual trade of the Venta is small. Some day a German
      doctor will start a nerve-healing establishment here, with a table d'hote
      at six o'clock, and every opportunity for practising the minor virtues&mdash;and
      the Valley of Repose will be the Valley of Repose no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It is a good omelette,&rdquo; said the host of the Venta, as Miss Cheyne
      took up her fork. &ldquo;Though I have not always been a cook, nor yet an
      innkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised one finger, shook it from side to side in an emphatic negation,
      and laughed. Then he turned suddenly, and looked down into the valley with
      a grave face and almost a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had a history it appeared&mdash;and, rarer still, was willing to
      tell it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew too much of the Spanish race, or perhaps of all men, to ask
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said pleasantly, &ldquo;it is a good omelette.&rdquo; And the man turned
      sharply and looked at her as if she had said something startling. She
      noticed his action, and showed surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; he said with a laugh, &ldquo;only a coincidence&mdash;a mere
      accident. It is said by the peasants that the mind of a friend has wings.
      Perhaps it is so. As I looked down into the valley I was thinking of a man&mdash;a
      friend. Yes&mdash;name of a Saint&mdash;he was a friend of mine, although
      a gentleman! Educated? Yes, many languages, and Latin. And I&mdash;what am
      I? You see, Senorita, a peasant, who wears no coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he laughed heartily, only to change again suddenly to gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as I looked down into the valley I was thinking of my friend&mdash;and,
      believe me, you spoke at that moment with something in your voice&mdash;in
      your manner&mdash;who knows?&mdash;which was like the voice and manner of
      my friend. Perhaps, Senorita, the peasants are right, and the mind of my
      friend, having wings, flew to us at that moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady laughed, and said that it might be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that you are English,&rdquo; the innkeeper continued, with easy
      volubility. &ldquo;For I know you belong to no other nation. I said so to myself
      the moment I saw you, riding up here on horseback alone. I called upstairs
      to Juanita that there was an English Senorita coming on a horse, and
      Juanita replied with a malediction, that I should raise my voice when the
      nino was asleep. She said that if it was the Pope of Rome who came on a
      horse he must not wake the child. 'No,' I answered, 'but he would have to
      go upstairs to see it;' and Juanita did not laugh. She sees no cause to
      laugh at anything connected with the nino&mdash;oh, no! it is a serious
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was looking towards the house as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juanita is your wife?&rdquo; said the Englishwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We have been married a year, and I am still sure that she is the
      most beautiful woman in the world. Is it not wonderful? And she will be
      jealous if she hears me talking all this while with the Senorita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell her that the Senorita has grey hair,&rdquo; said Miss Cheyne,
      practically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the innkeeper, looking at her with his head on one
      side, and a gravely critical air. &ldquo;But you still have the air&rdquo;&mdash;he
      shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his hands&mdash;&ldquo;the air that takes
      a man's fancy. Who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne, who had dealt much with a simple people, accustomed to the
      statement of simple facts in plain language, only laughed. There is a
      certain rough purity of thought which vanishes at the advance of
      civilisation. And cheap journalism, cheap fiction, cheap prudery have not
      yet reached Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; went on the man, with a shrewd, upward nod of the head.
      &ldquo;But the Senorita has a lover. He may be faithless, he may be absent, he
      may be dead&mdash;but he is there&mdash;the God be thanked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched his broad chest in that part where a deadly experience told him
      that the heart was to be found, and looked up to Heaven, all with a change
      of expression and momentary gravity quite incomprehensible to men of
      northern breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne laughed again without self-consciousness. Uneducated people
      have a way of arriving at once at those matters that interest rich and
      poor alike, which is rather refreshing, even to the highly educated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I, who talk like a washerwoman, forget that I am an innkeeper,&rdquo; said
      the man, with a truer tact than is often found under fine linen. And he
      proceeded to wait on her with a grand air, as if she were a queen and he a
      nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Juanita were about it would be different,&rdquo; he said, whipping the cloth
      from the table and shaking the crumbs to the four winds. &ldquo;And the Senorita
      would be properly served. But&mdash;what will you? the nino is but a
      fortnight old, and I&mdash;I am new at my trade. The Senorita takes
      coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne intimated that she did take coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, perhaps, will take a cup also,&rdquo; she added, whereupon the man
      bowed in his best manner. He had that perfect savoir-faire&mdash;a certain
      innate gentlemanliness&mdash;which is the characteristic of all Spaniards.
      His manner indicated an appreciation of the honour, and conveyed at the
      same time the intimation that he knew quite well how to behave under the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the house from which&mdash;all the doors and windows being
      open&mdash;came the sound of his conversation with Juanita, while he
      prepared the coffee. It was quite a frank and open conversation, having
      Miss Cheyne for its object, and stating that she had not only found the
      omelette good, but had eaten it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he returned with the coffee-pot, two cups, and a small jug of
      cream on a tray. He turned the handle of the coffee-pot towards Miss
      Cheyne, and conveyed in one inimitable gesture that he would take his
      coffee from no other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Senorita is staying in Palma?&rdquo; he asked, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;for business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The innkeeper laughed gaily and deprecatingly, as if between persons of
      their station business was a word only to be mentioned as a sort of jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the owner of a small property in the island&mdash;over in that
      direction&mdash;towards Soller. It is held on the 'rotas' system by a good
      farmer, who has frequently come to see me where I live at Monistrol, near
      Barcelona. He has often begged me to come to Majorca to see the property,
      and now I have come. I am staying a few days at Palma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farming is good in Majorca,&rdquo; said the man, shrewdly. &ldquo;You should receive
      a large sum for your share of the harvest. I, too, shall buy land
      presently when I see my chance, for I have the money. Ah, yes: I was not
      always an innkeeper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sipped his coffee pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me again of my friend,&rdquo; he said, after a pause. &ldquo;Why do I
      think of him this afternoon? It is a strange story; shall I tell it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be glad to hear it,&rdquo; replied Miss Cheyne, in her energetic way.
      She was stirring her coffee slowly and thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him in his own country&mdash;in America; and then in Cuba&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne ceased stirring her coffee suddenly, as if she had come
      against some object in the cup. A keen observer might have guessed that
      she had become interested at that moment in this idle tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You know Cuba?&rdquo; she said, indifferently interrogative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I know Cuba?&rdquo; he laughed, and spread out his hands in mute appeal to
      the gods. &ldquo;If I know Cuba! When Cuba is an independent republic, Senorita&mdash;when
      the history of all this trouble comes to be written, you will find two
      names mentioned in its pages. The one name is Antonio. When you are an old
      woman, Senorita, you can tell your children&mdash;or perhaps your
      grandchildren, if the good God is kind to you&mdash;that you once knew
      Antonio, and took a cup of coffee with him. But you must not say it now&mdash;never&mdash;never.
      And the other name is Mateo. You can tell your children, Senorita, when
      your hair is white, that you once spoke to a man who was a friend to this
      Mateo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished with his gay laugh, as if he were fully alive to his own fine
      conceit, and begged indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been here&mdash;sitting where you sit now,&rdquo; he continued, with
      impressive gravity. &ldquo;He came to me: 'Antonio,' he said, 'There are five
      thousand men out there who want you.' 'Amigo,' replied I, 'there is one
      woman here who does the same'&mdash;and I bowed, and Mateo went away
      without me. I thought he had gone back there to conduct affairs&mdash;to
      fight in his careless way, with his tongue in his cheek, as it were. He
      did all with his tongue in his cheek&mdash;that queer Mateo. And then came
      a message from Barcelona, saying that he wanted me. Name of a dog, I went&mdash;for
      his letter was unmistakable. He had, it appeared, had an accident. I found
      him with his arm in a sling. He had been cared for in the house of an
      Englishwoman&mdash;so much he told&mdash;but I guessed more. This
      Englishwoman&mdash;well, he said so little about her, that I could only
      conclude one thing. You know, Senorita&mdash;when a man will not talk of a
      woman&mdash;well, it assuredly means something. But there was, it appears,
      another man&mdash;this man, I grind my teeth to tell you of it&mdash;he
      was a priest. One Bernaldez, whom we had both known in Cuba. He had, it
      appears, come over to Spain in ordinary dress; for he was too well known
      to travel as Bernaldez, the priest. He was a fine man&mdash;so much I will
      say for him. The Englishwoman was, no doubt, beautiful. Bernaldez met her.
      She did not know that he was a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antonio paused, shrugged his shoulders and spread out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil did the rest, Senorita. And she? Did she care for him? Ah&mdash;one
      never knows with women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they do not always know themselves,&rdquo; suggested Miss Cheyne,
      without meeting her companion's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is so, Senorita. At all events, Mateo went to these two,
      when they were together. Mateo was always quick and very calm. He faced
      Bernaldez, and he told the woman. Then he left them. And I found him in
      Barcelona, two days afterwards, living at the Hotel of the Four Nations,
      like one in his sleep. 'If Bernaldez wants me,' he said, 'he knows where
      to find me.' And the next day Bernaldez came to us, where we sat in front
      of the Cafe of the Liceo on the Rambla. 'Mateo,' he said, 'you will have
      to fight me.' And Mateo nodded his head. 'With the revolver.' Mateo looked
      up with his dry smile. 'I will take you at that game,' he said, 'for nuts'&mdash;in
      the American fashion, Senorita&mdash;one of their strange sad jokes. Then
      Bernaldez sat down&mdash;his eyes were hollow; he spoke like one who has
      been down to the bottom of misery. 'I know a place,' he said, 'that will
      suit our purpose. It is among the mountains, on the borders of Andorra.
      You take the train from Barcelona to Berga, the diligencia from Berga to
      Organa. Between Organa and La Seo de Urgel is a bridge called La Puente
      del Diabolo. I will meet you at this bridge on foot on Thursday morning at
      nine o'clock. We can walk up into the mountains together. I shall bring a
      small travelling clock with me. We shall stand it on the ground between
      us, and when it strikes, we fire.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antonio had, in the heat of his narrative, leant forward across the table.
      With quick gestures he described the whole scene, so that Miss Cheyne
      could see it as it had passed before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a madness, Senorita,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;which shows itself by a
      thirst for blood. I looked at Bernaldez. He was sane enough, but I think
      the man's heart was broken. 'It is well,' said Mateo; 'I am your man&mdash;at
      the Puente del Diabolo at nine o'clock on Thursday morning.' And mind you,
      Senorita, these were not Italians or Greeks&mdash;they were a Spaniard and
      an American&mdash;men who mean what they say, whether it be pleasant or
      the reverse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne was interested enough now. She sat, leaning one arm on the
      table, and her chin in the palm of her hand. She held her lip with her
      teeth, and watched the man's quick expressive face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were there at nine o'clock,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that Mateo, with his arm in
      a sling. We had passed the night at the hotel of the Libertad at Organa,
      where we both slept well enough. What will you?&mdash;when one is no
      longer young, the pulse is slow. The morning mist had descended the
      mountain side, the air was cold. There at the Puente, leaning against the
      wall, cloaked and quiet&mdash;was Bernaldez. 'Ah!' he said to me, 'you
      have come, too?' 'Yes, Amigo,' I answered, 'but I do not give the word for
      two friends to let go at each other. Your little clock can do that.' He
      nodded and said nothing. Senorita, I was sorry for the man. Who was I that
      I should judge? You remember, you, who read your Bible, the writing on the
      ground? Bernaldez led the way, and we climbed up into the mountains in the
      morning mist. Somewhere above us there was a little waterfall singing its
      eternal song. In the cloud, where we could not see him, a curlew hung on
      his heavy wings, and gave forth his low warning whistle. 'Have a care&mdash;have
      a care,' he seemed to cry. Presently Bernaldez stopped, and looked around
      him. It was a desolate place. 'This will do,' he said. 'And he who drops
      may be left here. The other may turn on his heel, say &ldquo;A Dios,&rdquo; and go in
      safety. 'Yes,' answered Mateo. 'This will do as well as any other place.'
      Bernaldez looked at him, with a laugh. 'Ah,' he said, 'you think that you
      are sure to kill me&mdash;but I shall, at all events, have a shot for my
      money. Who knows? I may kill you.' 'That is quite possible,' answered
      Mateo. Bernaldez threw back his cloak. He carried the little travelling
      clock in one hand&mdash;a gilt thing made in Paris. 'We will stand it
      here,' he said, 'on a rock between us.' We were in a little hollow far up
      the mountain side, and the mist wrapped us round like a cloak. I know
      these mountains, Senorita, for it was here that the fiercest of the
      fighting in the last Carlist War took place. There are many dead up there
      even now, who have never been found. I also was in that trouble&mdash;ah,
      no, I was not always an innkeeper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on with your story,&rdquo; said Miss Cheyne, curtly, and closed her teeth
      over her lower lip again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We stood there, then, and watched Bernaldez take the clock from its case.
      He held it to his ear to make sure that it was going. It seemed to me that
      it ticked as loud up there as a clock ticks in a room at night. Bernaldez
      set forward the hands till they stood at five minutes to eleven. 'The
      eleventh hour,' said Mateo, with his dry laugh. Bernaldez set the clock
      down again. He took off his hat and threw it down to mark the ground. 'Ten
      paces,' he said, and, turning on his heel, counted aloud. I looked
      half-instinctively at his bared head. The tonsure was still visible to any
      who sought it; for it was but half-grown over. Mateo counted his steps and
      then turned. The clock gave a little tick, as such clocks do, four minutes
      before they strike. It seemed to me to hurry its pace as we three stood
      listening in that silence. We could hear the whisper of the clouds as they
      hurried through the mountains. The clock gave another click, and the two
      men raised their pistols of a similar pattern. The little gong rang out,
      and immediately after two shots, one following the other. Bernaldez had
      fired first. Mateo&mdash;a man with a reputation to care for&mdash;took a
      moment longer for his aim. I heard Bernaldez's bullet sing past his ear
      like a mosquito. Bernaldez fell forward&mdash;thus, on his arm&mdash;and
      the clock had not ceased striking when we stood over him; and Mateo had
      held the pistol in his left hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The narrator finished abruptly with a quick gesture. All through his story
      he had added a vividness to his description by quick movements of the hand
      and head, by his flashing eyes, his southern fire, so that his hearer
      could see the scene as he had seen it; could feel the stillness of the
      mountains; could hear the whisper of the clouds; could see the two men
      facing each other in the mist. With a gesture he showed her how Bernaldez
      lay, on his face on the wet stones, with a half-concealed tonsure, turned
      towards heaven in mute appeal, awaiting the last great hearing of his case
      in that Court where there is no appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there we left him, Senorita,&rdquo; added Antonio, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, walked away from her to the edge of the great slope, and stood
      looking down into the valley that lay shimmering below him. After a time
      he came back slowly. In his simplicity he was not ashamed of dimmed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you this, Senorita,&rdquo; he said with a laugh, &ldquo;because you are an
      Englishwoman, and because this Mateo was my friend. He is an American. His
      name is Whittaker&mdash;Matthew S. Whittaker. And this afternoon I was
      reminded of him; I know not why. Perhaps it was something that I said
      myself, or some gesture that I made, which I had caught from him. If one
      thinks much about a person, one may catch his gestures or his manner: is
      it not so? And then you reminded me of him a second time. That was
      strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Cheyne, thoughtfully; &ldquo;that was strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to Cuba again at once, Senorita; that was a year ago. And I have
      never heard from him. If, as the peasants say, the mind of a friend has
      wings, perhaps Mateo's mind has flown on to tell me that he is coming. He
      said he would come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why was he coming back?&rdquo; asked Miss Cheyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Senorita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cheyne had risen, and was making ready to depart. Her gloves and
      riding-whip lay on the table. The afternoon was far spent, and already the
      shadows were lengthening on the mountain-side. She paid the trifling
      account, Antonio taking the money with such a deep bow that the smallness
      of the coin was quite atoned for. He brought her horse from the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse and the Senorita are both tired,&rdquo; he said, with his pleasant
      laugh. And, indeed, Miss Cheyne looked suddenly weary. &ldquo;It is not right
      that you should go by the mountain path,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It is so easy to lose
      the way. Besides, a lady alone&mdash;it is not done in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but in England women are learning to take care of themselves,&rdquo;
       laughed Miss Cheyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed her foot within his curved hands, and he lifted her to the
      saddle. All her movements were easy and independent. It seemed that she
      only stated a fact, and the man shook his head forebodingly. He belonged
      to a country which in some ways is a century behind England and America.
      She nodded a farewell, and turned the horse's head towards the mountain
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find my way,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only by good fortune,&rdquo; he answered, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had almost set when she reached Palma. At the hotel her lawyer,
      who had made the voyage from Barcelona with her, awaited her with
      impatience, while her maid leant idly from the window. In the evening she
      went abroad again, alone, in her independent way. She walked slowly on the
      Cathedral terrace, where priests lingered, and a few soldiers from the
      neighbouring barracks smoked a leisurely cigarette. All turned at
      intervals, and looked in the same direction&mdash;namely, towards the
      west, where the daylight yet lingered in the sky. The moon, huge and
      yellow, was rising over the mountains, above Manacor, at the eastern end
      of the island. One by one the idlers dropped away, moving with leisurely
      steps towards the town. In very idleness Miss Cheyne followed them. She
      knew that they were going to the harbour in anticipation of the arrival of
      the Barcelona steamer. She was on the pier with the others, when the boat
      came alongside. The passengers trooped off, waving salutations to their
      friends. One among them, a small-made, frail man, detached himself from
      the crowd, and made his way towards Miss Cheyne, as if this meeting had
      been prearranged&mdash;and who shall say that it was not?&mdash;by the dim
      decrees of Fate.

      IN A CROOKED WAY
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And let the counsel of thine own heart stand.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was almost dark, and the Walkham River is much overhung in the parts
      that lie between Horrabridge and the old brickworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bed of the river a man stumbled heavily along, trusting more to his
      knowledge of the river than to his eyesight. He was fishing dexterously
      with flies that were almost white&mdash;flies which seemed to suit
      admirably the taste of those small brown trout which never have the sense
      to leave alone the fare provided for their larger white brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he hooked a larger fish, and, not daring to step back beneath the
      overhanging oak, he proceeded to tire his fish out in the deep water. In
      ten minutes he brought it to the landing-net, and as he turned to open his
      creel his heart leapt in his breast. A man was standing in the water not
      two feet behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't insult you by telling you not to be frightened,&rdquo; said the voice
      of a gentleman. There was no mistaking it. The speaker stood quite still,
      with the water bubbling round his legs. He was hatless, and his hair was
      cut quite short.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought flashed across the fisherman's slow brain. Like the rest of his
      craft, he was slower of mind than of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, divining his thoughts, &ldquo;I'm from Dartmoor. You
      probably heard of my escape two days ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the other, quietly, while he wound in his line. &ldquo;I heard of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do they say I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the police have got a clue&mdash;as usual,&rdquo; replied the fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The escaped convict laughed bitterly, but the laugh broke off into a
      sickening cackle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been in those brickworks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all the time, meditating
      murder. I stole a loaf from a baker's cart; but man cannot live by bread
      alone; ah! Ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman held out his flask, which the other took, and opened the
      somewhat uncommon silver top with ease bred of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He poured himself out a full glass and drank it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't had that taste in my mouth for four years,&rdquo; he said, returning
      the flask. &ldquo;And you are guilty of felony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman probably knew this, for he merely laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Prince Town?&rdquo; the convict asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded, glancing in the direction of the rising moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you've read the rules on the gate? Parcere subjectis, cut in the
      stone over the top. Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said the convict, after a pause, during which they had
      waded back to the bank, &ldquo;whether you are going to help me or not? Heavens!
      I NEARLY killed you while you were playing that fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ya-as,&rdquo; drawled the fisherman. &ldquo;I take it that you must have been
      tempted. I never heard you, owing to the rush of the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both big men, and the convict stared curiously into the long,
      clean-shaven face of this calm speaker. A smile actually flickered for a
      moment in his desperate eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is your mackintosh, your waders, and your hat&mdash;also
      your rod-case with a long stick in it. The handle of your landing-net will
      do. Where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plymouth. I am going back by the seven-thirty from Horrabridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a return ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like that also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman was slowly disjointing his rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I told you to come and take 'em?&rdquo; he said, with the drawl again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convict looked him up and down with a certain air of competent
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there would be a very pretty fight,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh, which he
      checked when he detected the savour of the prison-yard that was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't time for the fight,&rdquo; said the fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there came a hot gasp of excitement from the convict's lips. His stake
      was a very large one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same slow, reflective manner, the fisherman unbuttoned the straps
      of his waders at the thigh, and sat down to unlace his brogues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pull 'em off for me. They're so damnably sopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up his leg, and the convict pulled off the wet fishing-stockings
      with some technical skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew them on over his own stockinged legs, and the fisherman kicked the
      brogues towards him. In exchange the convict handed him his own shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to wear these?&rdquo; the fisherman asked, with something in his voice
      that might have been amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they're a little out of shape, I'm afraid. The Queen is no judge of
      a shoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not!&rdquo; answered the other, lacing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said the convict, with a curious eagerness, &ldquo;that you have
      seen a bit of the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here and there,&rdquo; answered the other, searching for the return half of his
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you think, now, that a girl would wait four years for a chap who,
      in the eyes of the world, was not worth waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman, not being an absolute fool, knew that there was only one
      answer to give. But he was a kind-hearted man, so he told a lie. There was
      something about this convict that made him do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I should think she would. Girls are not always rational, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other said nothing. He took the mackintosh-coat and the creel and the
      rod-case without a word&mdash;even of thanks. His manners were brisker, as
      if the angler's lie had done him good. The change of costume was now
      complete, and the convict would pass anywhere for an innocent disciple of
      Isaac Walton.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they stood thus, looking at each other. Then the convict
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you lend me a fiver?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carelessly opening his purse, and displaying a good number of bank-notes,
      he passed one to the unsteady hand held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want any more?&rdquo; he asked, with a queer laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take another if you can spare it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second note passed from hand to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the convict. &ldquo;Now, tell me your name and address; I shall
      want to send these things back to you if&mdash;if I have any luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the effort to steady his voice was quite apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caleb S. Harkness, United States frigate Bruiser, now lying at Plymouth,&rdquo;
       replied the other, tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you are an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I don't care a d&mdash;n for your laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MR. Harkness&mdash;or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm her captain,&rdquo; he replied modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only as he plodded along the Tavistock Road, limping in the
      regulation shoes, that the American remembered that he had quite omitted
      to ask the convict any questions. He had parted with his mackintosh, and
      it was pouring. Tavistock was two miles off, and he had no notion what
      trains there were to Plymouth. Yet he regretted nothing, and at times a
      queer smile flitted over his countenance. He was a man holding very
      decided views of his own upon most subjects, and no one suspected him of
      it, because he never sought to force them upon others. What he loved above
      all in men was that species of audacious and gentlemanly coolness which is
      found in greater perfection in the ranks of the British aristocracy than
      anywhere else in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the sort of man to be afraid of any one, or two, or three men&mdash;he
      had never, for a moment, thought of fearing the fellow who had gone off
      with his mackintosh, his waders, and his two five-pound notes. We all try
      to be our ideal, and Caleb S. Harkness prided himself on being the coolest
      man in the two hemispheres. He had met a cooler, and rather than
      acknowledge his inferiority he had parted with the valuables above
      mentioned, with no other guarantee of their safe return than a gentlemanly
      inflection of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later he received his waders, mackintosh, and brogues; also a new
      fishing-rod of the very best quality made in England, and two five-pound
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      America loves to show her appreciation of her great sons, but she does not
      always do it wisely when she begins to cast honours about. If England
      showed the same appreciation, some of us would not be so cruelly
      industrious with our pens; but that is the affair of the British public,
      who suffer most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb S. Harkness was bound to get on. Firstly, because his audacity was
      unrivalled, and secondly, he knew it was wise to be audacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course he rose as high as he conveniently could in the Navy active,
      and turned his attention to the Navy passive, which latter means a nice
      little house in Washington, and the open arms of the best society in that
      enlightened city. Here also he got on, because men were even more
      impressed by his audacity than the sea had been. Also he developed a new
      talent. He found within himself an immense capacity for making others
      appear ridiculous, and there is no man in the world so sensitive as your
      American senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in six years' time we find Caleb S. Harkness moving, not in the bed
      of an English trout-stream, but in the lap of Washingtonian luxury. It was
      a great night in the Government city, for England had sent one of her
      brightest stars to meet the luminaries of the United States in peaceful
      arbitration. The British Plenipotentiary had not yet been seen of the
      multitude&mdash;but he was the eldest son of a British Earl, and had a
      title of his own. That was enough for Washington, with some to spare for
      Boston and New York. Also he had proved himself equal to two American
      statesmen and their respective secretaries. He was, therefore, held in the
      highest esteem by all the political parties except that to which the
      worsted statesmen belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President's levee was better attended than usual; that is to say,
      there was not even room on the stairs, and America's first-born, as per
      election, had long ago lost all feeling in the digits of his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb S. Harkness was moving about in the quieter rooms, awaiting the
      great crush, when a lady and a man entered and looked around them with
      some amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated Admiral Harkness, when his slow and mournful eyes
      rested on the lady. The exclamation, if profane, was justified, for it is
      probable that the American had never before set eyes on such a masterpiece
      of the Creator's power. There was in this woman's being&mdash;in her eyes,
      her face, her every movement&mdash;that combination of nonchalance and
      dignity which comes to beautiful and bright-minded girls when they are
      beginning to leave girlhood behind them. She was moderately tall, with
      hair of living brown, and deep blue eyes full of life and sweetness. She
      was not slim, but held herself like a boy with the strength that comes of
      perfect proportion. She was one of those women who set a soldier or a
      sailor thinking what manner of men her brothers must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caleb Harkness observed all this with the unobtrusive scrutiny of his
      nation. He was standing near a curtained doorway buttoning his glove, and
      some one coming behind him pushed against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Harkness,&rdquo; said a voice, and the Chief Secretary of the
      English Legation patted him on the shoulder. &ldquo;Didn't see you. Looking for
      some one. By George, what a heat! Ah! there he is&mdash;thank goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went towards the lady and man who had just entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Monty, you're wanted at once,&rdquo; Harkness heard him say to the youth,
      who appeared to be a few years younger than his beautiful companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a few words to the lady, who replied laughingly, and the British
      Attache came towards Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harkness,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;want to introduce you to Lady Storrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The American followed with a smile on his lean face. He knew that he was
      being introduced to Lady Storrel merely because there happened to be no
      one else at hand and her cavalier was wanted elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Storrel, let me present to you Admiral Harkness, the man,&rdquo; he added,
      over his shoulder, &ldquo;who is going to make the United States the first Naval
      Power in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a good-natured laugh the two men went off, speaking hurriedly
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; asked the lady, smiling with that mixture of girlishness
      and English grand-ladyism, which was so new to Caleb S. Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I am not going to tell you how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please don't. Of course, you are an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you need not mind that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked, looking at him frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it,&rdquo; he answered, with a twinkle in his grave eyes, which she saw,
      and liked him for, &ldquo;that you want some one to listen to your impressions
      of&mdash;all this. It IS rum, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;it is&mdash;RUM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they had found a seat beneath a marvellous stand of
      flowers, and she was chattering away like a schoolgirl while he listened,
      and added here and there a keen comment or a humorous suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she began talking of herself, and in natural sequence of her
      husband, of their home in England, of his career, and her hatred of
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; she said suddenly, at the end of it, &ldquo;here IS my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harkness followed the direction of her glance, and looked upon a man in
      English Court-dress coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, in a peculiar, dull voice, &ldquo;that is your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling upon the man who approached, beckoning to him to come with
      her eyes, as women sometimes do. She turned sharply upon Harkness, her
      attention caught by something in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harkness had risen with a clatter of his sword on the polished floor, and
      stood awaiting the introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband&mdash;Admiral Harkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men bowed, and, before they could exchange a banal observation, the
      fair young man who had been called away came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew, this is worse than Simla,&rdquo; he said; then, offering his arm to Lady
      Storrel, &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I have discovered some ices, THE most
      lovely ices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They moved away, the lady favouring Harkness with a little nod, leaving
      the two tallest men in that assembly facing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, Caleb S. Harkness and Lord Storrel looked into each
      other's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Harkness, lapsing suddenly into a twang, &ldquo;she waited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded. He raised his perfectly gloved hand to his moustache,
      which he tugged pensively to either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;she waited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked round the room, and, seeing that they were almost alone, he
      moved towards the seat just vacated by his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I will tell you a little story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know it?&rdquo; enquired Harkness, when they were seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don't want to hear it! You'd better keep it to yourself, I
      reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman gave a little laugh, and lapsed into silence&mdash;thinking
      abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to tell you some of it, for my own sake. I don't want you
      to go away thinking&mdash;something that is not the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather not have the story,&rdquo; persisted Harkness. This American had
      some strange notions of a bygone virtue called chivalry. &ldquo;Give me a few
      facts&mdash;I will string them together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Storrel was sitting forward on his low chair, with his hands clasped
      between his knees. They were rather large hands&mdash;suggestive of manual
      labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he said, without looking round, &ldquo;that a man is in a street row
      in Dublin, when no one knows he is even in the town. Suppose the&mdash;eh&mdash;English
      side of the question is getting battered, and he hits out and kills a
      drunken beast of an Irish agitator. Suppose an innocent man is accused of
      it and the right chap is forced to come forward and show up UNDER A FALSE
      NAME and gets five years. Suppose he escapes after three and a half, and
      goes home, saying that he has been in America, cattle ranching&mdash;having
      always been a scapegrace, and a ne'er-do-well, who never wrote home when
      he had gone off in a huff. Suppose he had tried all this for the sake of&mdash;a
      girl, and had carried it through&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caleb Harkness had discovered that the identity of the British
      Plenipotentiary had become known to some of the more curious of the
      President's guests, who were now mooning innocently around them as they
      sat. He moved in his chair as if to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I can suppose all that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman's nerve was marvellous. He saw what Harkness had seen a
      moment before, and over his face came the bland smile of an intelligent
      English man talking naval matters with an American admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am at your mercy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at yours once; so now we are quits, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the two big men rose and passed out of the room together.

    <h2>
      THE TALE OF A SCORPION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spain is a country where custom reigns supreme. The wonder of to-day is by
      to-morrow a matter of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who came a second time to the Cafe Carmona in the Calle Velasquez
      in Seville must have known this; else the politely surprised looks, the
      furtive glances, the whisperings that met his first visit would have sent
      him to some other house of mild entertainment. The truth was that the Cafe
      Carmona was, and is still, select; with that somewhat narrow
      distinctiveness which is observed by such as have no friendly feelings
      towards the authorities that be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a small Cafe, and foreigners had better not look for it. Yet this
      man was a foreigner&mdash;in fact an Englishman. He was one of those
      quiet, unobtrusive men, who are taller than they look, and more important
      than they care to be considered. He could, for instance, pass down the
      crowded Sierpe of an evening, without so much as attracting a glance; for,
      by a few alterations in dress, he converted his outward appearance into
      that of a Spaniard. He was naturally dark, and for reasons of his own he
      spared the razor. His face was brown, his features good, and a hat with a
      flat brim is easily bought. Thus this man passed out of his hotel door in
      the evening the facsimile of a dozen others walking in the same street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he had no great reason for doing this. He preferred, he said, to
      pass unnoticed. But at the Foreign Office it was known that no man knew
      Spain as Cartoner knew it. Some men are so. They take their work
      seriously. Cartoner had looked on the map of Europe some years before for
      a country little known of the multitude, and of which the knowledge might
      prove to be of value. His eye lighted on Spain; and he spent his next
      leave there, and the next, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently there was no one at the Foreign Office who could hold a
      candle to Cartoner in matters Spanish. That is already something&mdash;to
      have that said of one. He is a wise man nowadays who knows something
      (however small it be) better than his neighbour. Like all his kind, this
      wise man kept his knowledge fresh. He was still learning&mdash;he was
      studying at the Cafe Carmona in the little street in Seville, called
      Velasquez.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he pushed the inner glass door open and lounged into the smoke-filled
      room, the waiter, cigarette in mouth, nodded in a friendly way without
      betraying surprise. One or two old habitues glanced at him, and returned
      to the perusal of La Libertad or El Imparcial without being greatly
      interested. The stranger had come the night before. He liked the place&mdash;the
      coffee suited his taste&mdash;&ldquo;y bien,&rdquo; let him come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter came forward without removing the cigarette from his lips;
      which was already a step. It placed this new-comer on a level with the
      older frequenters of the Carmona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cafe?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cafe!&rdquo; replied the stranger, who spoke little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had selected a little table standing rather isolated at one end of the
      room, and he sat with his back to the wall. The whole Cafe Carmona lay
      before him, and through the smoke of his cigarette he looked with quiet,
      unobtrusive eyes, studying... studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently an old man entered. This little table was his by right of
      precedence. He had been sitting at it the night before when the Englishman
      had elected to sit beside him; bowing as he did so in the Spanish manner,
      and clapping his hands in the way of Spain, to call the waiter when he was
      seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this evening the turn of the old man to bow, and the Englishman
      returned his salutation. They sat some time in silence, but when Cartoner
      passed the sugar the innate politeness of the Spaniard perceived the call
      for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency is not of Seville?&rdquo; he said, with a pleasant smile on his
      wrinkled, clean-shaven face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The keen old face hardened suddenly, until the features were like the
      wrinkles of a walnut; and the Spaniard drew himself up with all the
      dignity of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet eyes of Cartoner of the Foreign Office never left his face.
      Cartoner was surprised; for he knew Spain&mdash;he was aware that the
      Peninsular War had not been forgotten. He had never, in whatsoever place
      or situation, found it expedient to conceal his nationality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Spaniard slowly unfolded his cloak, betraying the shabbiness of
      its crimson plush lining. He lighted a cigarette, and then the national
      sense of politeness prevailed against personal feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency knows Gibraltar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the old man, with a grave bow. &ldquo;I thought&mdash;the
      Spanish of His Excellency misled me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman laughed quietly. &ldquo;You took me for a scorpion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      am not that. I learnt your language here and in the mountains of
      Andalusia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I beg the pardon of His Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner made a Spanish gesture with his hand and shoulders, indicating
      that no such pardon was called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not love the Scorpion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniard's eyes lighted up with a gleam which was hardly pleasant to
      look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HATE them,&rdquo; he hissed, bringing his face close to the quiet eyes; and
      the Spanish word means more than ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw himself back in his chair with an upward jerk of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have good reason to do so,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I sometimes wonder why I ever
      speak to an Englishman; for they resemble you in some things, these
      Scorpions. This one had a fair moustache, blue eyes, clean-cut features,
      like some of those from the North. But he was not large, this one&mdash;the
      Rock does not breed a large race. They are mean little men, with small
      white hands and women's feet. Ah, God! how I hate them all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman took a fresh cigarette from a Russia leather case, and
      pushed the remainder across the table for his companion to help himself
      when he had finished mashing the crooked paper between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your language,&rdquo; the Spaniard went on, &ldquo;as well almost as you know
      mine. But I do not speak it now. It burns my throat&mdash;it hurts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner lighted his cigarette. He betrayed not the smallest feeling of
      curiosity. It was marvellous how he had acquired the manner of these
      self-contained Sons of the Peninsula.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman leant his elbow on the table, and his chin within his hand,
      gazing indifferently out over the marble tables of the Cafe Carmona. The
      men seated there interchanged glances. They knew from the fierce old face,
      from the free and dramatic gestures, that old Pedro Roldos was already
      telling his story to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Santa Maria!&rdquo; the old man was saying. &ldquo;It is not a pleasant story. I
      lived at Algeciras&mdash;I and my little girl, Lorenza. Too near the Rock&mdash;too
      near the Rock. You know what we are there. I had a business&mdash;the
      contraband, of course&mdash;and sometimes I was absent for days together.
      But Lorenza was a favourite with the neighbours&mdash;good women who had
      known my wife when she was the beauty of St. Roque&mdash;just such a girl
      as Lorenza. And I trusted Lorenza; for we are all so. We trust and trust,
      and yet we know that love and money will kill honesty and truth at any
      moment. These two are sacred&mdash;more sacred than honesty or truth.
      Diavolo! What a fool I was. I ought to have known that Lorenza was too
      pretty to be left alone&mdash;ignorant as she was of the ways of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the neighbours began to throw out hints. They spoke of the English
      Caballero, who was so fond of riding round the Bay, and they hinted that
      it was not to see our old town of Algeciras that he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night I came home after a successful journey. I had been as far as
      Buceita with a train of five mules&mdash;a clear run. When I opened the
      door Lorenza was gone. Mother of God! gone&mdash;gone without a word! I
      went and fetched Nino&mdash;Nino, whose father had been my partner until
      he was shot by the Guardia Civile one night in the mountain behind Gaucin.
      There was no one like Nino for mule work in the mountains or for the
      handling of a boat when the west wind blew across the Bay. Nino, whom I
      wanted for a son-in-law, having no Nino of my own. I told him. He said
      nothing, but followed me to the quay and we got the boat out. In half an
      hour I was at the office of the Chief of the Police at Gibraltar. We sat
      there all night, Nino and I. By ten o'clock the next morning we knew that
      it was not one of the English officers&mdash;nor any civilian living on
      the Rock. 'It may,' said the Chief of Police, who seemed to know every one
      in his little district, 'be a passing stranger or&mdash;or a Scorpion. We
      do not know so much about them. We cannot penetrate to their houses.' I
      gave him a description of Lorenza; he undertook to communicate with
      England and with the Spanish police. And Nino and I went back to our work.
      It is thus with us poor people. Our hearts break&mdash;all that is worth
      having goes from our lives, and the end of it is the same; we go back to
      our work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paused. His cigarette had gone out long ago. He relighted it
      and smoked fiercely in silence for some moments. Cartoner made a sign to
      the waiter, who, with the intelligence of his race, brought a decanter of
      the wine which he knew the Spaniard preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the above relation Cartoner had never uttered a syllable. At
      the more violent points he had given a sympathetic little nod of the head&mdash;nothing
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was from that moment that I began to learn the difference between
      Englishmen and Scorpions,&rdquo; Pedro Roldos went on. &ldquo;Up to then I had not
      known that it made a difference being born on the Rock or in England. I
      did not know what a Scorpion was&mdash;with all the vices of England and
      Spain in one undersized body. I haunted the Rock. I learnt English. All to
      no avail. Lorenza was gone. Nino never said anything&mdash;he merely
      stayed by my side&mdash;but I think that something&mdash;some fibre had
      broken within him while he held the sheet that first night, sailing across
      the Bay in a gale of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus&mdash;for a year. Then came a letter from Cadiz. Lorenza was there,
      alone with her child. Her husband had deserted her in England, and she had
      got back to Cadiz. We went to her, Nino and I, in our boat. We brought her
      back; but she was no longer Lorenza. Our grief, our love were nothing to
      her. She was like a woman hewn out of marble. Maria! how I hated that man!
      You cannot understand&mdash;you Englishmen. Though there is something in
      your eyes, senor, which makes me think that you too could have felt as I
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Lorenza I learnt his name, and without telling her, I went across to
      Gibraltar. I inquired and found that he was there&mdash;there in
      Gibraltar. Almost within my grasp&mdash;think of that! At once I was
      cunning. For we are a simple people, except when we love or hate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cartoner, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour I knew where he lived. His father was an English groom who had
      set up large breeding stables in Gibraltar, and was a rich man. The son
      had the pretension of being a gentleman. He had been in England they told
      me for a year, buying stud-horses&mdash;and&mdash;and something else. He
      was married. Ah-ha! He had been married three years before he ever saw
      Lorenza, and the ceremony which had been observed in the English Church at
      Seville was a farce. My heart was hot within me; hot with the hatred for
      this man, and I sat in the Cafe Universal, which you know! Yes, you know
      everything. I sat there thinking of how I should kill him&mdash;slowly,
      taking my own time&mdash;talking to him all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I had learnt was no more than I expected. The woman (his wife), it
      appeared, was the daughter of a merchant at Gibraltar. They were a whole
      nest of Scorpions. I went back to Algeciras, and said nothing then to
      Lorenza. The next night I heard by chance that he and his wife and
      children had taken passage in a steamer that sailed for England in two
      days. Madre de Dio! he nearly slipped through our fingers. It was not a P.
      and O. ship: the passengers had to take a boat from the Old Mole, which is
      always crowded with Algeciras boats and others. Nino and I sailed across
      there and waited among the small craft. We saw the woman (his wife) and
      the children go on board in the afternoon. In the evening he came. I had
      arranged it with the licensed boatmen; a few pesetas did that. Our boat
      was nearest the steps. In the dim light of the quay lamp he noticed
      nothing, but stepped over the gunwale and mentioned the name of his
      steamer in a quick way, which he thought was that of the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nino took the oars, and when we were round the pier head we hoisted the
      sail. Then I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I am the father of Lorenza Roldos,' I said, 'and that man is Nino, her
      cortejo. We are going to kill you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He started up, and was about to raise a cry, when Nino whipped out his
      country knife. We carry them, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cartoner, speaking for the second time, &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was watching the old man now beneath the shadow of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you raise your voice,' I said, 'Nino will put his knife through your
      throat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him glance sideways at the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You would have no chance that way,' I said; 'I would turn the boat on
      you, and run you down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave a sort of gasp, and I had the happiness of hearing his teeth
      chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have money,' he said, in his thin, weak voice; 'not here, on board.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We said nothing, but I hauled in the sheet a little, and ran for the
      Europa light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'We are going to kill you,' I said quietly, without hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We landed just beyond the lighthouse, where there are no sentinels, and
      we made him walk up the Europa Road past the Governor's house. Nino's
      knife was within two inches of his throat all the while. I think he knew
      that his end was near. You know the Third Europa Advance Battery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cartoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cliff recedes there. There is a drop of four hundred metres, and then
      deep water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was there,&rdquo; hissed the old Spaniard, with a terrible gleam in his
      eyes. &ldquo;We sat there on the low walk, and I spoke to him. As we came along,
      Nino had said to me in our dialect: 'With a man like this, fear is better
      than pain;' and I knew that he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did not touch him with our knives. We merely spoke to him. And then we
      began quietly making our arrangements. That man died a hundred times in
      the ten minutes wherein we ballasted him. We tied heavy stones upon his
      body&mdash;we filled his pockets with smaller ones. We left his arms free,
      but to the palm of each hand we bound a stone as large as my head. The
      same to each foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I said, 'Lie down! Hands and legs straight out! It is only right
      that a Scorpion should die from his own rock, and taking some souvenirs
      with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took his arms and Nino his feet. We swung him three times, and let him
      fly into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lorenza never forgave us. She told me that she loved him still. One
      never comes to understand a woman!&rdquo;

      ON THE ROCKS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;For they are blest that have not much to rue&mdash;
      That have not oft misheard the prompter's cue.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The gale was apparently at its height&mdash;that is to say, it was blowing
      harder than it had blown all through the night. But those whose business
      is on the great waters know that a gale usually finishes its wrath in a
      few wild squalls. &ldquo;'Tis getting puffy,&rdquo; the sailors say; &ldquo;'tis nearly
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A man hurrying through the narrow main street of Yport was thrown against
      the shutters of the little baker's shop on the left-hand side, and stood
      there gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It's a dog's night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wiped the rain from his face. The wind, which blew from a wild
      north-west, roared against the towering cliffs, and from east and west
      concentrated itself funnel-wise on the gap where Yport lies. Out seaward
      there was a queer, ghostly light lying on the face of the waters&mdash;the
      storm-light&mdash;and landsmen rarely see it. For the sea was beaten into
      unbroken foam. The man, who was clad in oilskins, was in the neck of the
      funnel. Overhead, he heard the wind roaring through the pines far up on
      the slope of the narrow valley&mdash;close at hand, a continuous whistle
      told of its passage across the housetops. The man steadied himself with
      his left hand. He had but one, and he cursed the empty sleeve which
      flapped across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that I can waken that cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crept on, while the gale paused to take breath, and a moment later
      cowered in the porch of a little yellow house. He kicked the door with his
      heel and then waited, with his ear to the great keyhole. Surely the cure
      must have been a good man to sleep in such a night. The street had
      naturally been deserted, for it was nearly three o'clock in the morning,
      and dawn could not be far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A one-armed man and a priest!&rdquo; said the man to himself, with an
      expressive jerk of the head. And, indeed, all the men of Yport had sailed
      for the Northern fisheries, leaving the village to the women and children,
      and the maimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the house there were sounds of some one astir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One comes!&rdquo; cried a cheery voice belonging assuredly to some one who was
      brave, for none expects to be called from his bed to hear good news. A
      single bolt was drawn and the door thrown open. The cure&mdash;a little
      man&mdash;stood back, shading the candle with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Jean Belfort! it is you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I and my one arm,&rdquo; replied the man, coming in and closing the door.
      The rain dripped from his oilskins to the clean floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but this is no night to complain. Better be on shore with one arm
      than at sea with two to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little cure looked at his visitor with bright eyes, and a shake of the
      head. A quick-spoken man this, with a little square mouth, a soft heart, a
      keen sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you got me from my bed, malcontent?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because there are some out there that want your prayers,&rdquo; replied
      Belfort, jerking his head towards the sea. He was an unbeliever, this
      maimed sailor, who read the Petit Journal, and talked too loudly in the
      Cafe de la Marine of an evening. He spoke mockingly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can pray in the morning. Come with me while I get on some clothes&mdash;if
      it is a wreck,&rdquo; said the priest, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man followed him to a little bare room, of which the walls were
      decorated by two cheap sacred prints and a crucifix, such as may be bought
      for ten sous at any fair on the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind your hat,&rdquo; said the priest, seeing the man's fingers at the
      strings of his sou'wester. &ldquo;Give me my great boots from the cupboard. A
      wreck is it? The summer storms are always the worst. Is it a boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;It is my wife who looked from the window an
      hour ago, and saw a light at sea two points to the east of north&mdash;a
      red light and then a green and then the masthead light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would appear; and now there are no lights. That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest was dressed, and now pulled on a great oilskin coat. There are
      men who seem compact in mind and body, impressing their fellows with a
      sense of that restfulness which comes of assured strength. This little
      priest was one of these, and the mental impress that he left upon all who
      came in contact with him was to the effect that there is nothing in a
      human life that need appal, no sorrow beyond the reach of consolation&mdash;no
      temptation too strong to be resisted. The children ran after him in the
      streets, their faces expectant of a joke. The women in the doorways gave a
      little sigh as he passed. A woman will often sigh at the thought of that
      which another woman has lost, and this touches a whole gamut of thoughts
      which are above the reach of a man's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest tied the strings of a sou'wester under his pink chin. He was
      little more than a boy after all&mdash;or else he was the possessor of a
      very young heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between us we make a whole man&mdash;you and I,&rdquo; he said cheerily.
      &ldquo;Perhaps we can do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the night, the priest locking the door and pausing to
      hide the key under the mat in the porch. They all keep the house-door key
      under the mat at Yport. In the narrow street, which forms the whole
      village, running down the valley to the sea, they met the full force of
      the gale, and stood for a moment breathlessly fighting against it. In a
      lull they pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the tide?&rdquo; shouted the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is high at four o'clock&mdash;a spring tide, and the wind in the
      north-west&mdash;not standing room on the shore against the cliff for a
      man from here to Glainval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At high tide the waves beat against the towering cliff all along this grim
      coast, and a man standing on the turf may not recognize his son on the
      rocks below, while the human voice can only span the distance in calmest
      weather. There are spaces of three and four miles between the gaps in the
      great and inaccessible bluffs. An evil lee-shore to have under one's
      quarter&mdash;one of the waste places of the world which Nature has set
      apart for her own use. When Nature speaks it is with no uncertain voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is old Loisette,&rdquo; shouted the cure. &ldquo;He may have gone to bed
      sober.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason to suppose it,&rdquo; shouted the man in reply. &ldquo;No, my
      father, if there is aught to be done, you and I must do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What with the wind and the flannel ear-flaps of the sou'wester, it was
      hard to make one's self heard, and the two faces almost touched&mdash;the
      unbeliever who knew so little, and the priest who knew not only books but
      men. They made their way to the little quay, or, rather, the few yards of
      sea-wall that protect the houses at the corner of the street. But here
      they could not stand, and were forced to retire to the lee side of the
      Hotel de la Plage, which, as all know, stands at the corner, with two
      timorous windows turned seaward, and all the rest seeking the comfort of
      the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few words Belfort explained where the light had been seen, and where,
      according to his judgment, the steamer must have taken the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the good God has farther use for any of them, he will throw them on
      the shore a kilometre to the east of us, where the wire rope descends from
      the cliff to the shore for the seaweed,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What must be done must be done quickly. Let us go,&rdquo; said the little cure
      in his rather bustling manner, at which the great, slow-limbed fishermen
      were wont to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Along the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a rising tide racing in before a north-westerly wind?&rdquo; said Belfort,
      grimly, and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? You have your two legs, and there is Some One&mdash;up there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have thought it,&rdquo; answered the man, glancing up at the
      storm-driven clouds. &ldquo;However, where a priest can go a one-armed man can
      surely follow. We need lanterns and a bottle of brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I will wait and watch here while you fetch them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, left alone, peered round the corner, shading his eyes with his
      soft, white hand, upon which the cold rain pattered. To the east of him he
      knew that there were three miles of almost impassable shore, of unbroken,
      unscalable cliff. To the west of him the same. On the one hand Fecamp,
      five miles away by a cliff path that none would attempt by night, nine
      miles by road. On the other hand Etretat, still further by road and cliff
      path. Inland a few farms and many miles of forest. He and Belfort had
      stumbled over the fallen telegraph wires as they struggled down the
      village street. No; if there was a wreck out there in the darkness, and
      men, clinging half-drowned to the rigging, were looking towards the shore,
      they had better look elsewhere. The sea, like the wind, treated Yport as
      the mouth of a funnel, and a hundred cross currents were piling up such
      waves as no boat could pass, though the Yport women were skilful as any
      man with oar or sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Belfort returned carrying two lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told her that we will not quit the seawall,&rdquo; he said with a short
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      And straightway they both clambered over the wall and down the iron ladder
      to the beach. A meandering, narrow pathway is worn on the weed-grown chalk
      from the village to the washing-ground on the beach, a mile to the
      eastward, where, at low tide, a spring of fresh water wells up amid the
      shingle and the rock. Along this pathway the two men made their way, the
      cure following on his companion's heel. They stumbled and fell many times.
      At every step they slipped, for their boots were soaked, and the chalk was
      greasy and half decomposed by the salt water. At times they paused to
      listen, and through the roar of the wind and sea came the distant note of
      a bell clanging continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the bell on Fecamp pier,&rdquo; said Belfort. &ldquo;The mist is coming before
      the dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the east the long arm of Fecamp light swung slowly round the horizon,
      from the summit of the great bluff of Notre Dame du Salut, as if sweeping
      the sea and elbowing away all that dared approach so grim a coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the priest, &ldquo;I am in the water&mdash;the tide is coming
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To their left a wall of foam and spray shut off all view of the sea. On
      the right the cliff rose, a vast barrier, and cut the sky in two. These
      two men had nothing in common. They had, indeed, standing between them
      that sword which was brought into the world nineteen hundred years ago,
      and is still unsheathed. But neither thought of turning back. It had been
      agreed between them that they should make what speed they could along the
      shore, and only turn back at the last moment, searching the sea and beach
      as they returned in the light of dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belfort, the leader, the expert in night and tide and wind, led the way
      with one eye on the sea, the other on the eastern sky, which was now
      showing grey through tossing clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we must turn,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;and the last half-mile to the
      sea-wall we shall have to wade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paused and looked up to the sky. In half an hour the day would come,
      but in seventy minutes the breakers must beat against the sheer cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None has reached the shore alive and with his senses,&rdquo; said Belfort,
      looking out to sea. &ldquo;He would have seen our lights and come to us, or
      called if he had broken limbs. It is useless to search the shore too
      closely. We shall find them here at the edge, half in, half out,
      especially those with life belts, such as we find any winter morning after
      bad weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke grimly, as one who knew that it is not the deep sea that must be
      paid its toll, but the shoal water where the rocks and quicksands and
      crabs and gulls are waiting. They made their way back in silence, and
      slowly a new grey day crept into life. At last they could see the horizon
      and read the face of the water still torn into a seething chaos of foam.
      There was no ship upon them. If there had been a wreck the storm had done
      its work thoroughly. Belfort climbed to the summit of a rock, and looked
      back towards Fecamp. Then he turned and searched the shore towards Yport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;half in, half out, as I said. We shall cheat
      the crabs at all events, my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And clambering down, he stumbled on with a reckless haste that contrasted
      strangely with his speech. For, whatever our words may be, a human life
      must ever command respect. Any may (as some have done) die laughing, but
      his last sight must necessarily be of grave faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one is not dead,&rdquo; said the priest, when they had turned the man over
      and dragged him to dry land. Belfort cut away the life-belt, examining it
      as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They will have to wait over there in London, till he
      can tell them what ship it was. See, he has been struck on the head. But
      he is alive&mdash;a marvel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, meeting the priest's eyes, and, remembering his words spoken
      under the lee of the wall of the Hotel de la Plage, he laughed as a fencer
      may laugh who has been touched beyond doubt by a skilful adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a small-made man and light enough to carry&mdash;some town mouse
      this, my father&mdash;who has never had a wet jacket before&mdash;see his
      face how white it is, and his little arms and hands. We can carry him,
      turn and turn about, and shall reach the sea-wall before the tide is up,
      provided we find no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was full daylight when they at length reached the weed-grown steps at
      the side of the sea-wall, and the smoke was already beginning to rise from
      the chimneys of Yport. The gale was waning as the day came, but the sea
      was at its highest, and all the houses facing northward had their wooden
      shutters up. The waves were breaking over the sea-wall, but the two men
      with their senseless burden took no heed of it. They were all past
      thinking of salt water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to their summons, the Mother Senneville came hastily enough to
      the back door of the Hotel de la Plage&mdash;a small inn of no great
      promise. The Mother Senneville was a great woman, six feet high, with the
      carriage of a Grenadier, the calm eye of some ruminating animal, the soft,
      deep voice, and perhaps the soft heart, of a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already!&rdquo; she said simply, as she held the door back for them to pass in.
      &ldquo;I thought there would likely be some this morning without the money in
      their pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one will not call too loud for his coffee,&rdquo; replied Belfort, with a
      cynicism specially assumed for the benefit of the cure. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he
      added, as they laid their burden on the wine-stained table, &ldquo;if he has
      papers that will tell us the name of the ship, I will walk to Fecamp, to
      Lloyds' agents there, with the news. It will be a five-franc piece in my
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hastily searched the dripping clothing, and found a crumpled
      envelope, which, however, told them all they desired to know. It was
      addressed to Mr. Albert Robinson, steamship Ocean Waif, Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will suffice,&rdquo; said Belfort. &ldquo;I take this and leave the rest to you
      and Mother Senneville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send the doctor from Fecamp,&rdquo; said the woman&mdash;&ldquo;the new one in the
      Rue du Bac. It is the young ones that work best for nothing, and here is
      no payment for any of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Belfort, tossing off the brandy, which the Mother Senneville
      had poured out for him. &ldquo;You&mdash;you expect so much in the Hereafter,
      Mr. the Cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;you expect so much in the present, Mr. the one-armed
      malcontent,&rdquo; replied the priest, with his comfortable little laugh. &ldquo;Come,
      Madame Senneville. Let me get this man to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an Englishman, of course,&rdquo; said the Mother Senneville, examining
      the placid white face. &ldquo;They throw their dead about the world like
      cigar-ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By midday the news was in the London streets, and the talk was all of
      storms and wrecks and gallant rescues. And a few whose concern it was
      noted the fact that the Ocean Waif, of London, on a voyage from Antwerp
      and Southampton to the River Plate, had supposedly been wrecked off the
      north coast of France. Sole survivor, Albert Robinson, apparently a
      fireman or a steward, who lay at the Hotel de la Plage at Yport,
      unconscious, and suffering from a severe concussion of the brain. By
      midday, also, the cure was established as sick nurse in the back bedroom
      of the little hotel with an English conversation-book, borrowed from the
      schoolmaster, protruding from the pocket of his soutane, awaiting the
      return of Albert Robinson's inner consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you feeling better?&rdquo; the cure had all ready to fire off at him as
      soon as he awoke. To which the conversation-book made reply: &ldquo;Yes, but I
      have caught a severe chill on the mountain,&rdquo; which also the cure had made
      ready to understand&mdash;with modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the day passed away without any use having been found for the
      conversation-book. And sundry persons, whose business it was, came and
      looked at Albert Robinson, and talked to the priest and to Jean Belfort&mdash;who,
      to tell the truth, made much capital and a number of free glasses of red
      wine out of the incident&mdash;and went away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cure passed that night on the second bed of the back bedroom of the
      Hotel de la Plage, and awoke only at daylight, full of self-reproach, to
      find his charge still unconscious, still placid like a statue, with cheeks
      a little hollower, and lips a little whiter. The young doctor came and
      shook his head, and discoursed of other cases of a similar nature which he
      had read up since the previous day, and pretended now to have remembered
      among his experiences. He also went away again, and Yport seemed to drop
      out of the world once more into that oblivion to which a village with such
      a poor sea front and no railway station, or lodging houses, or hotels
      where there are waiters, must expect to be consigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cure had just finished his dejeuner of fish and an omelette&mdash;the
      day being Friday&mdash;when a carriage rattled down the village street,
      leaving behind it doorways suddenly occupied by the female population of
      Yport wiping its hands upon its apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Francois Morin's carriage from Fecamp,&rdquo; said the Mother Senneville,
      &ldquo;with a Parisienne, who has a parasol, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; corrected the cure; &ldquo;that is an Englishwoman. I saw several last
      year in Rouen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he hurried out, hatless, conversation-book in hand. He was rather
      taken aback&mdash;never having spoken to a person so well-dressed as this
      English girl, who nodded quickly in answer to his salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the hotel? Is he here? Is he conscious yet?&rdquo; she asked in
      tolerable French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;madam. He is here, but he is not conscious yet. The doctor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not madam&mdash;I am mademoiselle. I am his sister,&rdquo; said the girl,
      quickly descending from the carriage and frankly accepting the assistance
      of the cure's rather timid hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her meekly, wondering at her complete self-possession&mdash;at
      an utter lack of ceremony&mdash;at a certain blunt frankness which was new
      to Yport. She nodded to Madame Senneville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Cure will show you. It is he who has saved his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady turned and looked into the priest's pink face, which grew
      pinker. This was not the material of which gallant rescuers are usually
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Monsieur le Cure,&rdquo; she said, with a sudden gentleness. &ldquo;Thank
      you. It is so difficult&mdash;is it not?&mdash;to thank any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not the necessity,&rdquo; murmured the little cure, rather confusedly;
      and he led the way upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the sick-room he found his tongue again, and explained matters
      volubly enough. Besides, she made it easy. She was so marvellously
      natural, so free from a certain constraint which in some French circles is
      mistaken for good manners. She asked every detail, and made particular
      inquiry as to who had seen the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one must be allowed to see him,&rdquo; she said, in her decisive way. &ldquo;He
      must be kept quite quiet. No one must approach this room, only you and I,
      Monsieur le Cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been so good&mdash;you have done such wonders, that I rely upon
      you to help me;&rdquo; and a sudden, sharp look of anxiety swept across her
      face. &ldquo;We shall be good friends&mdash;n'est ce pas?&rdquo; she said, turning to
      look at him as he stood near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be easy, I think, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Madame Senneville, who was carrying the baggage
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his sister, Madame Senneville,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She will, of course, stay
      in the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I have no room ready,&rdquo; replied the huge woman, pessimistically.
      &ldquo;One never knows what a summer storm may bring to one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mother Senneville, no; one never knows,&rdquo; he said rather absently, and
      went out into the street. He was thinking of the strange young person
      upstairs, who was unlike any woman he had met or imagined. Those in her
      station in life whom he had seen during his short thirty years were mostly
      dressed-up dolls, to whom one made banal remarks without meaning. The rest
      were almost men, doing men's work, leading a man's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening the injured man recovered consciousness, and it was the
      cure who sent off the telegram to the doctor at Fecamp. For the wire had
      been repaired with the practical rapidity with which they manage such
      affairs in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the slow recovery it was the cure who was ever at the beck and
      call of the two strangers, divining their desires, making quite easy a
      situation which otherwise might have been difficult enough. Not only the
      cure, but the whole village soon became quite reconciled to the hitherto
      unheard-of position assumed by this young girl, without a guardian or a
      chaperon, who lived a frank, fearless life among them, making every day
      terrible assaults upon that code of feminine behaviour which hedges
      Frenchwomen about like a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intimacy of the sick-room the little priest soon learnt to talk
      with the Englishwoman and her brother quite freely, as man to man, as he
      had talked to his bosom friend by selection at St. Omer. And there was in
      his heart that ever-abiding wonder that a woman may thus be a companion to
      a man, sharing his thoughts, nay, divining them before he had shaped them
      in his own mind. It was all very wonderful and new to this little priest,
      who had walked, as it were, on one side of the street of life since
      boyhood without a thought of crossing the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the three were together they were merry enough; indeed, the
      Englishman's mistakes in French were sufficient to cause laughter in
      themselves without that re-action which lightens the atmosphere of a
      sick-room when the danger is past. But while he was talking to the Mother
      Senneville downstairs, or waiting a summons to come up, the cure never
      heard laughter in the back bedroom. There seemed to be some shadow there
      which fled before his cheery smile when he went upstairs. When he and the
      girl were together when she walked on the sea-wall with him for a breath
      of air, she was grave enough too, as if now that she knew him better she
      no longer considered it necessary to assume a light-heartedness she did
      not feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure there is nothing I can do to make your life easier here?&rdquo; he
      asked suddenly one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; she answered without conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you all that you want, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he felt that there was some anxiety weighing upon her. He was always
      at or near the Hotel de la Plage now, so that she could call him from the
      window or the door. One day&mdash;a day of cloud and drizzle, which are
      common enough at Yport in the early summer&mdash;he went into the little
      front room, which the Mother Senneville fondly called her salon, to read
      the daily office from the cloth-bound book he ever carried in his pocket.
      He was engaged in this devout work when the Englishwoman came hastily into
      the room, closing the door and standing with her back against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a gendarme in the street,&rdquo; she said, in little more than a
      whisper, her eyes glittering. She was breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it, mademoiselle? It is my old friend the Sergeant Grall. It is I
      who christen his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is his duty, mademoiselle. The village is peaceful enough now that the
      men are away at the fisheries. You have nothing to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced round the room with a hunted look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I cannot keep it up any longer. You must have guessed&mdash;you
      who are so quick&mdash;that my brother is a great criminal. He has ruined
      thousands of people. He was escaping with the money he had stolen when the
      steamer was wrecked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cure did not say whether this news surprised him or not, but walked to
      the window and looked thoughtfully out to sea. The windows were dull and
      spray-ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the girl cried, &ldquo;you must not judge hastily. You cannot know his
      temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not judge at all, mademoiselle. No man may judge of another's
      temptation. But&mdash;he can restore the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It was all lost in the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had approached the other window, and stood beside the little priest
      looking out over the grey sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was surely my duty to come here and help him, whatever he had done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he says you can give him up if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him and caught her breath. The priest shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Because you are too charitable?&rdquo; she whispered; and again he
      shook his head. &ldquo;Then, why not?&rdquo; she persisted with a strange pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is your brother, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they stood for some moments looking out over the sea, through the
      rime-covered windows, in a breathless silence. The cure spoke at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get him removed to Havre,&rdquo; he said, in his cheery way, &ldquo;as soon
      as possible. There he can take a steamer to America. I will impress upon
      the doctor the necessity of an early departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not lately, but many years ago, that the Ocean Waif was wrecked in
      a summer storm. And any who penetrate to Yport to-day will probably see in
      the sunlight on the sea-wall a cheery little cure, who taps his snuff-box,
      while he exchanges jokes with the idlers there. Yport has slowly crept
      into the ken of the traveller, and every summer sees English tourists pass
      that way. They are not popular with the rough natives, who, after all, are
      of the same ancestry as ourselves; but the little cure is quick and kind
      with information or assistance to all who seek it. When the English tongue
      is spoken he draws near and listens&mdash;snuff-box in hand; when the
      travellers speak in French his eyes travel out to sea with a queer look,
      as if the accent aroused some memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in an obscure English watering-place there lives a queer little old
      maid&mdash;churchy and prim&mdash;who does charitable work, gives her
      opinion very freely concerning the administration of matters parochial,
      thinks the vicar very self-indulgent and idle&mdash;and in her own heart
      has the abiding conviction that there are none on earth like the Roman
      clergy.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;GOLOSSA-A-L&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golossa-a-l!&rdquo; I heard him say. &ldquo;Golossa-a-l, these Englishmen! Are they
      not everywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later I was introduced to him, and he rose to shake hands&mdash;a
      tall, fair, good-natured German student. Heavy if you will&mdash;but clean
      withal, and of a cleanly mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour,&rdquo; he muttered politely. &ldquo;It is not often we have an English
      student at Gottingen&mdash;but perhaps we can teach you something&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
       And he broke into a boyish laugh. &ldquo;You will take beer?&rdquo; he added, drawing
      forward an iron chair&mdash;for we were in the Brauerei Garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A doctor of medicine&mdash;the Herr Professor tells me,&rdquo; he said
      pleasantly. &ldquo;Prosit,&rdquo; he added, as he raised his great mug to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prosit! Yes, a doctor of medicine&mdash;of the army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of the army, that is good. I also I hope, some day! And you come to
      pass our Gottingen examination. Yes, but it is hard&mdash;ach Gott!&mdash;devilish
      hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a restrained shyness about the man which I liked. Shy men are so
      rare. And, although he could have cleared the Brauerei Garden in five
      minutes, there was no bluster about this Teutonic Hercules. His loud,
      good-natured laugh was perhaps the most striking characteristic of Carl
      von Mendebach. Next to that, his readiness to be surprised at everything
      or anything, and to class it at once as colossal. Hence the nickname by
      which he was known amongst us. The term was applied to me a thousand times&mdash;figuratively.
      For I am a small man, as I have had reason to deplore more than once while
      carrying the wounded out of action. It takes so much longer if one is
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot exactly say why Carl von Mendebach and I became close friends;
      but I do not think that Lisa von Mendebach had anything to do with it. I
      was never in love with Lisa, although I admired her intensely, and I never
      see a blue-eyed, fair-haired girl to this day without thinking of Lischen.
      But I was not in love with her. I was never good-looking. I did not begin
      by expecting much from the other sex, and I have never been in love with
      anybody. I wonder if Lisa remembers me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The students were pleasant enough fellows. It must be recollected that I
      speak of a period dating back before the war of 1870&mdash;before there
      was a German Empire. I soon made a sort of place for myself at the
      University, and I was tolerated good-naturedly. But Carl did more than
      tolerate me. He gave me all the friendship of his simple heart. Without
      being expansive&mdash;for he was a Hanoverian&mdash;he told me all about
      himself, his thoughts and his aims, an open-hearted ambition and a very
      Germanic contentment with a world which contained beer and music. Then at
      last he told me all about his father, General von Mendebach, and Lisa.
      Finally he took me to his house one evening to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said in his loud, cheery way, &ldquo;here is the Englishman&mdash;a
      good friend of mine&mdash;a great scholar&mdash;golossa-a-l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General held out his hand and Lisa bowed, prettily formal, with a
      quaint, prim smile which I can see still.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went to the house often&mdash;as often, indeed, as I could. I met the
      Von Mendebachs at the usual haunts&mdash;the theatre, an occasional
      concert, the band on Sunday afternoon, and at the houses of some of the
      professors. It was Lisa who told me that another young Briton was coming
      to live in Gottingen&mdash;not, however, as a student at the University.
      He turned out to be a Scotsman&mdash;one Andrew Smallie, the dissolute
      offspring of a prim Edinburgh family. He had been shipped off to
      Gottingen, in the hope that he might there drink himself quietly to death.
      The Scotch do not keep their skeletons at home in a cupboard. They ship
      them abroad and give them facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrew Smallie soon heard that there was an English student in Gottingen,
      and, before long, procured an introduction. I disliked him at once. I took
      good care not to introduce him to any friends of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seem to lead a quiet life here,&rdquo; he said to me one day when I had
      exhausted all conversation and every effort to get him out of my rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know anybody? It's a deuced slow place. I don't know a soul to
      talk to except yourself. Can't take to these beer-drinking, sausage-eating
      Germans, you know. Met that friend of yours, Carl von Mendebach,
      yesterday, but he didn't seem to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;It is possible he did not know you. You have never
      been introduced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered dubiously. &ldquo;Shouldn't think that would matter in an
      out-of-the-way place like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may seem out of the way to you,&rdquo; I said, without looking up from my
      book. &ldquo;But it does not do so to the people who live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;d slow lot, I call them,&rdquo; he muttered. He lighted a cigar and
      stood looking at me for some time and then he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time that Carl von Mendebach fought his first student
      duel, and he was kind enough to ask me to be his surgeon. It was, of
      course, no quarrel of his own, but a point of honour between two clubs;
      and Carl was selected to represent his &ldquo;corps.&rdquo; He was delighted, and the
      little slit in his cheek which resulted from the encounter gave him
      infinite satisfaction. I had been elected to the &ldquo;corps&rdquo; too, and wore my
      cap and colours with considerable pride. But, being an Englishman, I was
      never asked to fight. I did not then, and I do not now, put forward any
      opinion on student duelling. My opinion would make no difference, and
      there is much to be said on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard winter, and I know few colder places than Gottingen. An ice
      fete was organized by the University. I believe Carl and I were among the
      most energetic of the organizers. I wish I had never had anything to do
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember to this day the pleasure of skating with Lisa's warmly gloved
      little hands in my own&mdash;her small furred form touching me lightly
      each time we swung over to the left on the outside edge. I saw Andrew
      Smallie once or twice. Once he winked at me, knowingly, as I passed him
      with Lisa&mdash;and I hated him for it. That man almost spoilt Gottingen
      for me. Britons are no friends of mine out of their own country. They
      never get over the fallacy that everywhere except London is an
      out-of-the-way place where nothing matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening wore on, some of the revellers became noisy in a harmless
      German way. They began to sing part songs with a skill which is not heard
      out of the Fatherland. Parties of young men and maidens joined hands and
      swung round the lake in waltz time to the strain of the regimental band.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa was tired, so she sought a seat with the General, leaving Carl and me
      to practise complicated figures. They found a seat close to us&mdash;a
      seat somewhat removed from the lamps. In the dusk it was difficult to
      distinguish between the townspeople and the gentlefolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were absorbed in our attempts when I heard a voice I knew&mdash;and
      hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you, little girl in the fur jacket&mdash;come and have a turn with
      me,&rdquo; it was saying in loud, rasping, intoxicated tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned sharply. Smallie was standing in front of Lisa with a leer in his
      eyes. She was looking up at him&mdash;puzzled, frightened&mdash;not
      understanding English. The General was obesely dumfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along&mdash;my dear,&rdquo; Andrew Smallie went on. He reached out his
      hand, and, grasping her wrist, tried to drag her towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went for him. I am, as I have confessed, a small man. But if a man
      on skates goes for another, he gathers a certain impetus. I gave it to him
      with my left, and Andrew Smallie slid along the ice after he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General hustled Lisa away, muttering oaths beneath his great white
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Andrew Smallie picked himself up, Carl von Mendebach was standing
      over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Carl in German, &ldquo;that that was my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Smallie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Carl von Mendebach slowly drew off his fur glove and boxed Smallie
      heavily on the ear so that he rolled over sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golossa-a-l,&rdquo; muttered Von Mendebach, as we went away hurriedly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Carl sent an English-speaking student with a challenge to
      Andrew Smallie. I wrote a note to my compatriot, telling him that although
      it was not our habit in England, he would do well to accept the challenge
      or to leave Gottingen at once. Carl stood over me while I wrote the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where he can procure fencing lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave Smallie the name of the best fencing-master in Gottingen. Then we
      called for beer and awaited the return of our messenger. The student came
      back looking grave and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He accepts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; we both exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He names pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I cried. Carl laughed suddenly. We had never thought of such a
      thing. Duelling with pistols is forbidden. It is never dreamt of among
      German students.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;all right!&rdquo; said Carl. &ldquo;If he wishes it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I at once wrote a note to Smallie, telling him that the thing was
      impossible. My messenger was sent back without an answer. I wrote,
      offering to fight Carl myself with the usual light sword or the sabre, in
      his name and for him. To this I received no answer. I went round to his
      rooms and was refused admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at five&mdash;before it was light&mdash;Carl and I
      started off on foot for a little forest down by the river. At six o'clock
      Andrew Smallie arrived. He was accompanied by an Einjahriger&mdash;a
      German who had lived in England before he came home to serve his year in
      the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not know much about it. Carl laughed as I put him in position. The
      fresh pink of his cheek&mdash;like the complexion of a healthy girl&mdash;never
      faded for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I've done with him,&rdquo; cried Smallie, &ldquo;I'll fight you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We placed our men. The German soldier gave the word. Carl von Mendebach
      went down heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still smiling&mdash;with a strange surprise on his simple face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he has hit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lay quite still while I quickly loosened his coat. Then suddenly his
      breath caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golossa-a-l!&rdquo; he muttered. His eyes glazed. He was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up and saw Smallie walking quickly away alone. The Einjahriger
      was kneeling beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen or heard of Andrew Smallie since. I am a grey-haired man
      now. I have had work to do in every war of my day. I have been wounded&mdash;I
      walk very lame. But I still hope to see Andrew Smallie&mdash;perhaps in a
      country where I can hold him to his threat; if it is only for the
      remembrance of five minutes that I had with Lisa when I went back to
      Gottingen that cold winter morning.

    <h2>
      THE MULE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Si je vis, c'est bien; si je meurs, c'est bien.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ai-i-ieah,&rdquo; the people cried, as Juan Quereno passed&mdash;the cry of the
      muleteers, in fact. And this was considered an excellent joke. It had been
      a joke in the country-side for nearly twenty years; one of perhaps half a
      dozen, for the uneducated mind is slow to comprehend, and slower to
      forget. Some one had nicknamed Juan Quereno the &ldquo;Mule&rdquo; when he was at
      school, and Spain, like Italy and parts of Provence, is a country where
      men have two names&mdash;the baptismal, and the so-called. Indeed, the
      custom is so universal, that official records must needs take cognizance
      of it, and grave Government papers are made out in the name of so-and-so,
      &ldquo;named the monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were, after all, worse by-names in the village than the Mule, which
      is, as many know, a willing enough beast if taken the right way. If taken
      in the wrong&mdash;well, one must not take him in the wrong way, and there
      is an end of it! A mule will suddenly stop because, it would appear, he
      has something on his mind and desires to think it out then and there. And
      the man who raises a stick is, of course, a fool. Any one knows that.
      There is nothing for it but to stand and watch his ears, which are a
      little set back, and cry, &ldquo;Ai-i-ieah,&rdquo; patiently and respectfully, until
      the spirit moves him to go on. And then the mule will move on, slowly at
      first, without enthusiasm, a quality which, by the way, is, of all the
      animals, only to be found in the horse and the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick-witted who had dealings with Quereno knew, therefore, by his
      name what manner of man this was, and dealt with him accordingly. Juan
      Quereno was himself a muleteer, and in even such a humble capacity as
      scrambling behind a beast of burden over a rocky range of mountains and
      through a stream or two, a man may make for himself a small reputation in
      his small world. Juan Quereno was, namely, a Government muleteer, and
      carried the mails over nineteen chaotic miles of rock and river. When the
      mails were delayed owing, it was officially announced, to heavy snow or
      rain in the mountains, the delay never occurred on Quereno's etapa.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nine years, winter and summer, storm and shine, he got his mails
      through, backwards and forwards, sleeping one night at San Celoni, the
      next at Puente de Rey. Such was Juan Quereno, &ldquo;a stupid enough fellow,&rdquo;
       the democratic schoolmaster of San Celoni said, with a shrug of his
      shoulders and a wave of the cigarette which he always carried half-smoked
      and unlighted in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster was, nevertheless, pleasant enough when the Mule,
      clean-shaven and shy, with a shrinking look in his steady, black eyes,
      asked one evening if he could speak to him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes&mdash;amigo!&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but yes.&rdquo; And he drew aside on the
      bench that stands at the schoolhouse door. &ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mule sat down, leant heavily against the wall, and thrust out first
      one heavy foot and then the other. Then he sat forward with his elbows on
      his knees, and looked at his dusty boots. His face was tanned a deep brown&mdash;a
      stolid face&mdash;not indicative of much intelligence perhaps, not
      spiritual, but not bad on the other hand, which is something in a world
      that abounds in bad faces. He glanced sideways at the schoolmaster, and
      moistened his lips with his tongue, openly, after the manner of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about Caterina, eh?&rdquo; inquired the elder man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Mule, with a sort of gasp. If the Mule had ever been
      afraid in his life, it was at that moment&mdash;afraid, if you please, of
      a little democrat of a schoolmaster no bigger than the first-class boys,
      blinking through a pair of magnifying spectacles which must have made the
      world look very large, if one could judge from the effect that they had
      upon his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster looked up towards the mountains, to the goats poised
      there upon the broken ground, seeking a scanty herbage in the crannies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many beasts is it that you have&mdash;four or five?&rdquo; he inquired
      kindly enough, after a moment, and the Mule drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five,&rdquo; he replied; and added, after a minute's deep and honest thought,
      &ldquo;and good ones, except Cristofero Colon, the big one. He eats much, and
      yet, when the moment comes&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and looked towards the
      mountains, which rose like a wall to the south, a wall that the Mule must
      daily climb&mdash;&ldquo;when the moment comes he will sometimes refuse&mdash;especially
      in an east wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster smiled, thinking perhaps of that other Cristofero Colon
      and the east wind that blew him to immortal fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Caterina,&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What does she think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmaster looked at his companion with an upward jerk of the head.
      It was evident that he thought him a dull fellow. But that assuredly was
      Caterina's affair. It was, on the other hand, distinctly the affair of
      Caterina's father to remember those five beasts of the Mule's, than which
      there were none better in the country-side&mdash;to recollect that the
      Mule himself had a good name at his trade, and was trusted by the
      authorities. There was no match so good in all the valley, and certainly
      none to compare with this dull swain in the accursed village of San
      Celoni. The schoolmaster never spoke of the village without a malediction.
      He had been planted there in his youth with a promise of promotion, and
      promotion had never come. For a man of education it was exile&mdash;no
      newspapers, no passing travellers at the Cafe. The nearest town was twenty
      miles away over the Sierra Nevada, and Malaga&mdash;the paved Paradise of
      his rural dreams&mdash;forty rugged miles to the south. No wonder he was a
      democrat, this disappointed man. In a Republic, now, such as his father
      had schemed for in the forties, he would have succeeded. A Republic, it
      must be remembered, being a community in which every man is not only
      equal, but superior to his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Mule, with a dull look of shame at his own
      faint-heartedness. Moreover, he was assuredly speaking an untruth. The man
      who fears to inquire&mdash;knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, he had hardly spoken to Caterina. Conversation was
      not the Mule's strong point. He had exchanged the usual greetings with her
      at the fountain on a fiesta day. He had nodded a good morning to her,
      gruff and curt (for the Mule had no manners), more times than he could
      count. And Caterina had met his slow glance with those solemn eyes of
      hers, and that, so to speak, had settled the Mule's business. Just as it
      would have settled the business of five out of six men. For Caterina had
      Moorish eyes&mdash;dark and solemn and sad, which said a hundred things
      that Caterina had never thought of&mdash;which seemed to have some history
      in them that could hardly have been Caterina's history, for she was only
      seventeen. Though, as to this, one cannot always be sure. Perhaps the
      history was all to come. Of course, the Mule knew none of these things. He
      was a hard-working, open-air Andalusian, and only knew that he wanted
      Caterina, and, as the saying is, could not live without her. Meantime he
      lived on from day to day without that which he wanted, and worked&mdash;just
      as the reader may be doing. That, in fact, is life&mdash;to live on
      without something or other, and work. Than which there is one thing worse,
      namely, to live on and be idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, slowly, for Andalusian tongues are
      slow, if the knives are quick&mdash;&ldquo;but one may suppose that you would
      make her a good husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a sudden gruff laugh was the answer. A woman would have understood it;
      but Caterina had no mother. And the schoolmaster was thinking of the five
      beasts and the postal appointment. The muleteer's face slowly sank back
      into stolidity again. The light that had flashed across it had elevated
      that dull physiognomy for a moment only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Mule slowly, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read and write?&rdquo; inquired the man of education.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but not quickly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;is a matter of practice. You should read
      the newspapers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which was bad advice, for the Mule was simple and might have believed what
      he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was a long one; that is to say, it lasted a long time;
      until, indeed, the sun had set and the mountains had faded from blue to
      grey, while the far-off snow peaks reared their shadowy heads into the
      very stars. The schoolmaster had a few more questions to ask, and the Mule
      answered them in monosyllables. He was tired, perhaps, after his day's
      journey; for he had come the northward trip, which was always the hardest,
      entailing as it did a rocky climb on the sunny side of the mountains. He
      had nothing to say in his own favour, which is not such a serious matter
      as some might suspect. The world does not always take us at our own
      valuation, which is just as well&mdash;for the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the schoolmaster only succeeded in confirming his own suspicion
      that this was nothing but a dull fellow, and he finally had to dismiss the
      Mule, who had not even the savoir faire to perceive when conversation was
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vederemos,&rdquo; he said, judicially, &ldquo;we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Mule went away with that heaviness of heart which must surely
      follow a mean action. For he knew that in applying to Caterina's father he
      had placed Caterina at a disadvantage. The schoolmaster, be it remembered,
      was a democrat, and such are usually autocrats in their own house. He was,
      moreover, a selfish man, and had long cherished the conviction that he was
      destined to be great. He thought that he was an orator, and that gift,
      which is called by those who do not possess it the gift of the gab, is the
      most dangerous that a man can have. There was no one in San Celoni to
      listen to him. And if Caterina were married and he were a free man, he
      could give up the school and go to Malaga, where assuredly he could make a
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the schoolmaster told Caterina the next morning that she was to marry
      the Mule&mdash;that the matter was settled. The dusky roses faded from
      Caterina's cheek for a moment, and her great dark eyes had a hunted look.
      That look had often come there of late. The priest had noticed it, and one
      or two old women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost as if she were in the mountains,&rdquo; they said, which is a local
      polite way of referring to those unfortunate gentlemen who, for some
      reason or another, do not desire to meet the Guardia Civil, and haunt the
      upper slopes of the Sierra Nevada, where they live, as live the beasts of
      the forest, seeking their meat from God, while the charitable, and, it is
      even whispered, the priest or the Alcalde himself, will at times lay an
      old coat or a loaf of bread at the roadside above the village, and never
      inquire who comes to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mule himself, it is known, buys more matches than he can ever burn, so
      much as six boxes at a time, of those cheap sulphurous wooden matches that
      are made at Barcelona, and the next day will buy more. The Mule, however,
      is such a silent man that those who are &ldquo;in the mountains&rdquo; make no
      concealment with him, but meet him (wild, unkempt figures that appear
      quietly from behind a great rock) as he passes on his journeys, and ask
      him if he has a match upon him. They sometimes look at the mail-bags slung
      across the stubborn back of Cristofero Colon with eyes that have the
      hunted, hungry look which Caterina has.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, perhaps, money in there,&rdquo; they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answers the Mule, without afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a thousand pesetas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Mule, who is brave enough where Caterina is not concerned, quietly
      turns his back upon a man who carries a gun, and follows Cristofero Colon.
      It sometimes happens that he trudges his nineteen miles without meeting
      any one, with no companion but his mules and his dog. This last-named
      animal is such as may be met in Spain or even in France at any street
      corner&mdash;not a retriever, nor a foxhound, nor anything at all but a
      dog as distinguished from a cat or a goat, living a troubled and uncertain
      life in a world that will always cringe to a pedigree, but has no respect
      for nondescripts. It was on these journeys that the Mule had so much
      leisure for thought. For even he could think, according to his dim lights.
      He was only conscious, however, of an ever-increasing feeling of a
      sickness&mdash;a physical nausea (for he was, of course, a mere
      earthy-creature)&mdash;at the thought of a possible life without Caterina.
      And it was at the end of a grilling day that the schoolmaster beckoned to
      him as he passed the school-house, and told him that it was settled&mdash;that
      Caterina would marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to see her? She is indoors,&rdquo; inquired the bearer of the
      tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Mule, after a dull pause. &ldquo;Not to-night. I have my
      mail-bags, as you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he clattered on down the narrow street with a dazed look, as if the
      brightness of Paradise had flashed across his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was settled. Caterina and the Mule were to be married, and there had
      been no love-making, the old women said. &ldquo;And what,&rdquo; they asked, &ldquo;is youth
      for, if there is to be no love-making?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And God knows they were right,&rdquo; said the priest who heard the remark, and
      who was a very old man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after that, the Mule met Caterina as she was going to the
      fountain. He said &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo; They both stopped, and the Mule looked
      into Caterina's eyes and had nothing to say. For he saw something there
      which he did not understand, and which made him feel that he was no better
      than Cristofero Colon, scraping and stumbling up the narrow street with
      the mail-bags, in such a vile temper, by the way, that the Mule had to
      hurry after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a slow business,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster to Sergeant Nolveda, of the
      Guardia Civil, who lived in San Celoni and trained one young recruit after
      another according to the regulations of this admirable corps. For one
      never meets a Guardia Civil alone, but always in company&mdash;an old head
      and a pair of young legs. &ldquo;A slow business. He is not a lover such as I
      should choose were I a pretty girl like Caterina; but one can never tell
      with women&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, matters did not progress very quickly. The Mule appeared to take
      so much for granted&mdash;to take as said so much that had not been said.
      Even the love-making seemed to him to have been understood, and he
      appeared to be quite content to go his daily journeys with the knowledge
      that Caterina was to be his wife. There were, of course, others in the
      valley who would have been glad enough to marry Caterina, but she had
      shown no preference for any of these swains, who knew themselves inferior,
      in a worldly sense, to the Mule. So the whole country-side gradually
      accustomed itself also to the fact that Caterina was to marry Quereno. The
      news even spread to the mountains. The Mule heard of it there one day when
      he had accomplished fourteen daily journeys to the accompaniment of this
      new happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was nearing the summit of the pass he saw Pedro Casavel, who had
      been &ldquo;in the mountains&rdquo; three years, seated on a stone awaiting him. Pedro
      Casavel was a superior man, who had injured another in a dispute
      originating in politics. His adversary was an old man, now stricken with a
      mortal disease. And it was said that Pedro Casavel could safely return to
      the village, where his father owned a good house and some land. His enemy
      had forgiven him, and would not prosecute. But Casavel lingered in the
      mountains, distrusting so Christian a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as the Mule slowly approached. He carried a gun always, and was
      more daring than his companions in retreat. The Mule mechanically sought
      in his jacket pocket for a box of matches, which he knew would be a
      welcome gift, and held them out silently as he neared Casavel. But Casavel
      did not take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that you are to marry Caterina,&rdquo; he said, with a half disdainful
      laugh. &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered the Mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; cried the other, passionately, with a bang on the stock of
      his gun that startled Cristofero Colon&mdash;&ldquo;if you do, I will shoot
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mule smiled slowly, just as he smiled when the people cried
      &ldquo;Ai-i-ieah&rdquo; as he passed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry her,&rdquo; he said, with a shake of the head. And
      mechanically he handed the other the box of matches, which Casavel took,
      though his eyes still flashed with anger and that terrible jealousy which
      flows in Southern blood. Then the Mule walked slowly on, while his dog
      shambled after him, turning back once or twice to glance apprehensively at
      the man left standing in the middle of the rocky path. Dogs, it is known,
      have a keener scent than human beings&mdash;perhaps, also, they have a
      keener vision, and see more written on the face of man than we can
      perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mule turned at the summit of the pass, and looked down, as he always
      did, at the village where Caterina lived, before turning his face to the
      sunnier southern slope. He saw Casavel standing where he had left him,
      holding up the gun with a threatening gesture. The Mule had no eye for
      effect. He did not even shrug his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was finally the schoolmaster who hurried matters to their natural
      conclusion. By his advice, the Mule, who had hitherto lodged in the house
      of the postmaster, rented a cottage of his own and bought some simple
      furniture. He consulted Caterina on several points, and she was
      momentarily aroused from a sort of apathy which had come over her of late,
      by a very feminine interest in the kitchen fittings. The best that could
      be said for Caterina was that she was resigned. As for the Mule, like the
      animal from which he had acquired his habits of thought as well as his
      name, he seemed to expect but little from life. So, one morning before
      departing on his daily journey, the Mule was unobtrusively married to
      Caterina in the little pink stucco chapel that broods over the village of
      San Celoni like a hen over her chickens. And Cristofero Colon and the dog
      waited outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a commonplace ceremony, and at its conclusion the bridegroom
      trudged off up the village street behind his mail-bags. The Mule, it must
      be admitted, was a deadly dull person&mdash;y nada mas&mdash;and nothing
      more, as his fond father-in-law observed at the cafe that same morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he returned on the second evening, he made it evident that he had
      been thinking of Caterina in his absence, for he gave her, half shyly and
      very awkwardly, some presents that he had brought from a larger village
      than San Celoni, which he had passed on his way. There were shops in the
      village, and it was held in the district that articles bought there were
      of superior quality to such as came even from Granada or Malaga. The Mule
      had expended nearly a peseta on a coloured kerchief such as women wear on
      their heads, and a brooch of blue glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Caterina, taking the presents and examining them with
      bright eyes. She stood before him in a girlish attitude, folding the
      kerchief across her hand, and holding it so that the light of their new
      lamp fell upon it. &ldquo;It is very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mule had washed his face and hands at the fountain, as he came into
      San Celoni, remembering that he was a bridegroom. He stood, sleek and
      sunburnt, looking down at her, and, if he had only had the words, the
      love-making might have commenced then and there, at a point where the
      world says it usually ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing,&rdquo; he said slowly at length, &ldquo;in the shops that seemed
      to me pretty at all&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, and turned away to lay his beret
      aside, then, with his back towards her, he finished the sentence. &ldquo;Not
      pretty enough for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caterina winced, as if he had hurt instead of pleased her. She busied
      herself with the preparations for their simple supper, and the Mule sat
      silently watching her&mdash;as happy, perhaps, in his dull way, as any
      king has ever been. Then suddenly Caterina's fingers began to falter, and
      she placed the plates on the table with a clatter, as if her eyes were
      blinded. She hesitated, and with a sort of wail of despair, sat down and
      hid her face in her apron. And the Mule's happiness was only human after
      all, for it was transformed in the twinkling of an eye into abject misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat biting his lip, and looking at her as she sobbed. Then at length he
      rose slowly, and, going to her, laid his great, solid, heavy hand upon her
      shoulder. But he could not think of anything to say. He could only meet
      this as he had met other emergencies, with that silence which he had
      acquired from the dumb beasts amid the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after a long pause, he spoke. He had detected a movement, made
      by Caterina and instantly restrained, to withdraw from the touch of his
      hand, and this had set his slow brain thinking. He had dealt with animals
      more than with men, and was less slow to read a movement than to
      understand a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is it that you are sorry you married me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Caterina, who belonged to a people saying yea, yea, and nay, nay,
      nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Mule, with a deadly economy of words. And she did not
      answer him. &ldquo;Is it because&mdash;there is another man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was known in the valley that the Mule had never used his knife, not
      even in self-defence. Caterina did not dare, however, to answer him. She
      only whispered a prayer to the Virgin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Pedro Casavel?&rdquo; asked the Mule; and the question brought her to her
      feet, facing him with white cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What made you think that? Oh&mdash;no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woman-like, she thought she could fool him. The Mule turned away from her
      and sat down again. Woman-like, she had forgotten her own danger at the
      mere thought that Casavel might suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he&mdash;in the mountains,&rdquo; said the Mule, thinking aloud. He was
      beginning to see now, at last, when it was too late, as better men than he
      have done before, and will continue to do hereafter. Caterina could not
      have held out as an objection to her marriage the fact that she loved a
      man who was in the mountains. The schoolmaster was not one to listen to
      such an argument as that, especially from a girl who could not know her
      own mind. For the schoolmaster was, despite his radical tendencies,
      bigoted in his adherence to the old mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caterina might have told the Mule, perhaps, if he had asked her; for she
      knew that he was gentle even with the stubborn Cristofero Colon. But he
      had not asked her, failing the necessary courage to face the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, the woman who spoke first, in a quiet voice, with that
      philosophy of life which is better understood by women than by men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, at all events, eat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;after your journey. It is a
      cocida that I have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She busied herself among the new kitchen utensils with movements hardly
      yet as certain as the movements of a woman, but rather those of a child,
      hasty and yet deft enough. The Mule watched her, seated clumsily, with
      round shoulders, in the attitude of a field labourer indoors. When the
      steaming dish, which smelt of onions, was set upon the table, he rose and
      dragged his chair forward. He did not think of setting a chair in place
      for Caterina, who brought one for herself, and they sat down&mdash;to
      their wedding feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      They appeared to accept the situation, as the poor and the hard-worked
      have to accept the many drawbacks to their lot, without further comment.
      The Mule cultivated a more complete silence than hitherto; but he was
      always kind to Caterina, treating her as he would one of his beasts which
      had been injured, with a mutual silent acceptance of the fact that she had
      a sorrow, a weak spot as it were, which must not be touched. With a stolid
      tact he never mentioned the mountains, or those unfortunate men who dwelt
      therein. If he met Pedro Casavel he did not mention the encounter to
      Caterina. Neither did he make any reference to Caterina when he gave Pedro
      a box of matches. Indeed, he rarely spoke to Casavel at all, but nodded
      and passed on his way. If Casavel approached from behind he stopped
      without looking round, and waited for him just as his mules stopped, and
      as mules always do when they hear any one approaching from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So time went on, and the schoolmaster, resigning his situation, departed
      to Malaga, where, by the way, he came to no good; for of talking there is
      too much in this world, and a wise man would not say thank you for the
      gift of the gab. The man whom Pedro Casavel had injured died quietly in
      his bed. Caterina went about her daily work with her unspoken history in
      her eyes, while Pedro himself no doubt ate his heart out in the mountains.
      That he ate it out in silence could scarcely be, for the tale got about
      the valley somehow that he and Caterina had been lovers before his
      misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as for the Mule, he trudged his daily score of miles, and said nothing
      to any man. It would be hard to say whether he noticed that Pedro Casavel,
      when he showed himself now in the mountains, appeared rather
      ostentatiously without his gun&mdash;harder still to guess whether the
      Mule knew that as he passed across the summit Casavel would sometimes lie
      amid the rocks, and cover him with that same gun for a hundred yards or
      so, slowly following his movements with the steady barrel so that the
      mail-carrier's life hung, as it were, on the touch of a trigger for
      minutes together. Pedro Casavel seemed to shift his hiding place, as if he
      were seeking to perfect certain details of light and range and elevation.
      Perhaps it was only a grim enjoyment which he gathered from thus holding
      the Mule's life in his hand for five or six minutes two or three times a
      week; perhaps, after all, he was that base thing, a coward, and lacked the
      nerve to pull a trigger&mdash;to throw a bold stake upon life's table and
      stand by the result. Each day he crept a little nearer, grew more daring;
      until he noticed a movement made by the lank, ill-fed dog, that seemed to
      indicate that the beast, at all events, knew of his presence in the rocks
      above the footpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day, when there was no wind, and the light was good and the range
      had been ascertained, Pedro Casavel pulled the trigger. The report and a
      puff of bluish smoke floated up to heaven, where they were doubtless taken
      note of, and the Mule fell forward on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; he muttered, in the curt, Andalusian dialect. And then and
      there the Mule died.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to be Cristofero Colon's day to do the southward journey, and
      despite the lank dog's most strenuous efforts, he continued his way,
      gravely carrying the dusty mail-bags to their destination. The dog
      remained behind with the Mule, pessimistically sniffing at his clothing,
      recognizing, no doubt, that which, next to an earthquake, is the easiest
      thing to recognize in nature. Then at length he turned homewards, towards
      San Celoni, with hanging ears and a loose tail. He probably suspected that
      the Mule had long stood between him and starvation&mdash;that none other
      would take his place or remember to feed a dog of so unattractive an
      appearance and no pedigree whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caterina did not expect the Mule to return that evening, which was his
      night away from home at Puente de Rey. She hurried to the door, therefore,
      when she heard, after nightfall, the clatter of hoofs in the narrow
      street, and the shuffling of iron heels at her very step. She opened the
      door, and in the bright moonlight saw the cocked-hats and long cloaks of
      the Guardia Civil. There were other men behind them, and a beast shuffled
      his feet as he was bidden to stand still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;An accident to the Mule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that,&rdquo; replied the Sergeant, grimly, as he made way for two
      men who approached carefully, carrying a heavy weight. It was the Mule
      whom they brought in and laid on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shot,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, curtly. He had heard the gossip of the valley,
      and doubted whether Caterina would need much pity or consideration. His
      companion-in-arms now appeared, leading by the sleeve one who was
      evidently his captive. Caterina looked up and met his eyes. It was Pedro
      Casavel, sullen, ill-clad, half a barbarian, with the seal of the
      mountains upon him. &ldquo;The mail-bags are missing,&rdquo; pursued the Sergeant, who
      in a way was the law-giver of the valley. &ldquo;Robbery was doubtless the
      object. We shall find the mail-bags among the rocks. The Mule must have
      shown fight; for his pistol was in his pocket with one barrel discharged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he laid his hand upon the Mule's broad chest without heeding
      the stained shirt. That stain was no new sight to an old soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbery,&rdquo; he repeated, with a glance at Casavel and Caterina, who stood
      one on each side of the table that bore such a grim burden, and looked at
      each other. &ldquo;Robbery and murder. So we brought Pedro Casavel, whose
      hiding-place we have known these last two years, with us&mdash;on the
      chance, eh?&mdash;on the chance. It was the dog that came and told us.
      Whoever shot the man should have shot the dog too&mdash;for safety's
      sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Sergeant spoke, he mechanically made sure that the Mule's pockets
      were empty. Suddenly he stopped, and withdrew a folded paper from the
      inside pocket of the jacket. He turned towards the lamp to read the
      writing on it. It was the Mule's writing. The Sergeant turned, after a
      moment's thought, and faced Casavel again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free to go, Pedro,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have made a mistake, and I ask
      your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out the paper, which, however, Casavel did not take, but stood
      stupidly staring, as if he did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Sergeant turned to the lamp again. He unfolded the paper, which
      was crumpled as if with long friction in the pocket, and read aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let no one be accused of my death. It is I, who, owing to private
      trouble, shall shoot myself. Juan Quereno, so-called the 'Mule.'&rdquo;

     &ldquo;Secret de deux, secret de Dieu.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess anybody could be a soldier and swing a sword, while it takes brains
      to make a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I was a doctor, and a very young one in those days, new to the
      regiment and conscious of my inferiority to its merest subaltern. The
      young person who made the above observation was, moreover, pretty, with
      dark eyes and the most bewitching lips that ever gave voice to an American
      accent. My heart was young, and therefore easily stirred by such vanities&mdash;nothing
      stirs it now but the cry of the bugle and the sullen roar that rises from
      the ranks when, at last, T. Atkins is allowed to get to the bayonet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were sitting in the verandah of the Residency in the capital of a
      northern tributary state which need not be further specified here. The
      Rajah was in difficulties and unable, without our aid, to dispose of a
      claimant to his throne, whose hereditary right originated somewhere in the
      lifetime of St. Paul. General Elias J. Watson, of Boston, U.S.A., was
      travelling for the enlargement of his own and his daughter's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa is just going to write a book about things in general,&rdquo; explained Miss
      Bertha Watson, with a wise little smile, when her father's thirst for
      information became irksome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing in Simla that an expeditionary force was about to be despatched to
      the assistance of the Rajah of Oadpur, General Watson hastened thither. He
      had letters of introduction from sundry persons who wished to get rid of
      him to sundry others who had no desire to assist in any way. But the old
      man's naivete and characteristically simple interest in details soon made
      their way, while Bertha's wise little smile carried all before it. It
      somehow conveyed the impression that she knew a thing or two of which we
      were ignorant, and like one man we fell to desiring knowledge of those
      things. I was nowhere. Doctors never are anywhere in regimental
      competitions, for they are usually, like myself, deadly poor. Sometimes
      Bertha danced with me, as on this occasion, at the impromptu
      entertainments given by the Resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, shall we have another?&rdquo; she observed before my heart had recovered
      from the effect of the last remark. And she handed me the stationery
      department envelope which served as a programme on these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fumbled for my pencil in a seventh heaven of joy. I had read somewhere
      that women sometimes give their hearts to small and insignificant men. But
      it seemed unlikely that this referred to such women as Bertha Watson. I
      had never dreamt of cutting out the other men: Major Le Mesurier-Groselin,
      who had money, for instance, or Austin Graham&mdash;especially Austin
      Graham. There had been a rumour in the air&mdash;planted there, no doubt,
      by some of the women who have a marvellous scent for a light trail&mdash;that
      there was an understanding between Graham and Bertha. I noticed that she
      never looked at him with her bewitching little smile as she did at the
      rest of us. But that was all I could detect. Perhaps she thought that he
      was wiser than herself. Perhaps, moreover, she was right; for Graham was
      the wisest man up there, and I think the bravest. He meant business, he
      told me, and had come to make his name in this little war.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a quiet-going, fair man, with that inestimable advantage of looking
      at all times exactly what he was, namely, a gentleman by long descent. He
      was a great friend of mine, and we shared quarters in a sort of gatehouse
      to the Rajah's palace, where I knew that he worked night and day, for he
      was chief of the staff, and had a great scheme of crushing the
      insurrection, at one blow, by a surprise assault of the fortified town
      twenty miles away, where the claimant lay with his forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Bertha, when I had duly inscribed my name on the
      Government envelope, &ldquo;that this is what you call a demonstration in force.
      This is not serious war. You are not going to fight at all. Things are
      much too quiet and orderly&mdash;with church parade, and
      soirees-dansantes, and visiting cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me, and if I had had any secrets I should have told them to
      her then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think there'll be fighting,&rdquo; she added, with a calmness of
      demeanour which was in itself unusual and fascinating enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no reason to arrive at such a conclusion, for I had not uttered a
      sound. I probably did not know, however, in those days that the lies
      requiring the minutest care are the unspoken ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I'm only a doctor,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and, strange to say, the
      Brigadier has not as yet taken me into his confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a lot about war,&rdquo; she went on after a momentary pause. She
      appeared to have some misgiving about one of the buttons on her long glove
      which she had undone and was tentatively tugging at the thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I button that?&rdquo; I said hurriedly in my extreme youth, and with a
      palpitating courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;if you have any ambition that way.&rdquo; And she extended her
      arm towards me. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, with a grave air of confidence which I
      now distrust whenever it is tried upon me, &ldquo;if I was the man in charge of
      this show, I would just go on like this, giving balls and private
      theatricals and exchanging visiting cards. This place is full of spies, of
      course. The very servants who wait on the General probably read all his
      letters and send copies of them to the enemy. The plan of campaign is
      probably as well known to What-'em-you-call-it Khan as it is to the
      Brigadier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am sure it isn't,&rdquo; I interrupted; &ldquo;because Graham keeps it locked
      up in a medical-comfort chest with his dressing-case locked, which we
      screwed on ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, is that so, doctor? Well, you can't be too careful, can you? As I was
      saying, I should convey to the spies the impression that it was only a
      demonstration in force. Then one night I should start off quietly, march
      twenty miles, and give What-'em-you-call-it Khan Hail Columbia before
      sunrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me, gave a knowing little nod of the head, and began fanning
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my plan of campaign,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know Pa is here on purpose
      to see the British soldier fight. We have been waiting here a month now,
      and I hope you are going to ring up the curtain soon. Pa has theories
      about the British soldier, and although he is a General, you know he has
      never seen a fight. I tell him if I was a General who hadn't seen a fight,
      I'd just go out and sell myself cheap! What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you spoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said you'd probably do that at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not cheap,&rdquo; she answered gravely, and then we changed the subject. So far
      as I recollect, we returned to the discussion of doctors and their trade,
      and before long I had the opportunity of airing my special hobby at that
      time&mdash;the study of native drugs. Miss Watson was deeply interested&mdash;at
      least, she made me think so, and before we parted I had promised to send
      round to her &ldquo;diggings,&rdquo; as she called them, a bottle of a perfectly
      harmless narcotic which I had made up for the use of persons suffering
      from sea-sickness or toothache. I use it still, and have some always by me
      on service in a bottle labelled &ldquo;Bertha,&rdquo; for there is, after all,
      something in a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home to my quarters rather thoughtful that night; for Bertha
      Watson's plan of campaign was Austin Graham's plan of campaign, and I knew
      that Graham was not the man to divulge so much as a hint of this secret. I
      know now that if a woman loves a man she knows much that he never tells
      her, but I was ignorant of this and many other matters at the time when I
      made Bertha's acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days dragged on and we seemed to be no nearer solving the Rajah's
      difficulties. There were at that time no native newspapers, and bazaar
      gossip, which is, by the way, surer and speedier than the most enlightened
      press, made up for the want. Bazaar gossip held much the same opinion as
      Bertha Watson&mdash;namely, that we were only a demonstration in force.
      This opinion gained ground daily, and began like a hardy weed to throw out
      tendrils in the shape of details. We were afraid of the claimant to the
      throne, it seemed. We had quarrelled with the Rajah, and would not risk a
      defeat on his account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austin Graham came and went. I sometimes found mysterious natives waiting
      for him in our quarters. One of these natives spoke Hindustanee with a
      faint Scotch accent, and laughed when I told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm all right in the dialects though,&rdquo; he said, in Glasgow English, and
      asked for a cigarette. We sat and talked for half an hour awaiting
      Graham's arrival, but he never told me who he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, about midnight, I was aroused by Le Mesurier-Groselin, who was
      in full fighting kit and had a queer light in his eyes which was new to
      me, though heaven and the Horse Guards know that I have seen it often
      enough since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up&mdash;Sawbones!&rdquo; said Le Mesurier-Groselin. &ldquo;You'll be wanted at
      any rate, but now I want you badly. We're just off to smoke the old Khan
      out, and something has gone wrong with Graham. For God's sake, man, hurry
      up! It will be a pretty fight, and I would not miss it for worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Le Mesurier-Groselin as I hauled on my clothes. He had eight
      thousand a year, an Elizabethan manor in England, and the certainty of a
      baronetcy; but the thought of these things never brought to his eyes the
      light that was there now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is wrong with Graham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;wish I did. Can't move him. Seems quite stupid or dead
      drunk,&rdquo; answered Le Mesurier-Groselin, handing me my belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hurried upstairs to the room occupied by Austin Graham, and there found
      him lying on the bed with his eyes almost, but not quite, shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was he to-night&mdash;dining with you at mess?&rdquo; I asked, raising
      one heavy lid with my finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he dined with the Watsons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you last see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten o'clock at my quarters. He was coming here to change in time
      for the assembly at eleven forty-five&mdash;the column is just marching. I
      came here to hurry him up and found him like this. The whole attack is his
      planning. It would have been the making of him. He was to have led the
      ladders. Gad! what a chance the man had&mdash;and look at the poor devil
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was examining Austin Graham with a thumping heart, for a queer suspicion
      was in my mind. Presently I ran downstairs and uncorked the bottle which I
      now label &ldquo;Bertha.&rdquo; The smell was identical, and I went upstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me to get him into his boots and tunic,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Le Mesurier-Groselin and I huddled the man's fighting clothes on to
      him by the light of a flickering candle. Le Mesurier-Groselin was a big
      man, and my trade had taught me a certain skill in the handling of the
      dead. We soon had Austin Graham in full uniform sitting up in my arms,
      with the helmet crammed on his head at an unseemly angle. He was perfectly
      insensible, but his heart went well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now help me to get him on to his horse,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Le Mesurier-Groselin dropped his eye-glass for the first and last time on
      record, and looked at me with a surprised eye and a solemn one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll obey orders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I take it that you are very drunk or
      else mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We carried him downstairs and I climbed into Graham's saddle. Le
      Mesurier-Groselin lifted Graham, who must have weighed fourteen stone,
      into the saddle in front of me, and I rode twenty miles that night with
      him there. He recovered consciousness an hour before we reached the Khan's
      stronghold, and, as I expected, awoke, as if from sleep, refreshed and
      ready for any exertion. We had no time for explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were drugged,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;by some native spy, who must have got wind of
      the intended attack to-night. I knew that the stuff would have to run its
      course, so I did not physic you, but brought you along with the column.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I am glad to say he believed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one found me a restless field-artillery horse which was giving the
      gunners a lot of trouble, and I rode back to Oadpur alone&mdash;not having
      any business at the front. As I approached the old Gate House, the flutter
      of a white dress caught my eye. It was almost dawn, and a pink haze hung
      over the paddy-fields. The world had that appearance of peace and
      cleanliness which is left by the passage of an Indian night. My rooms were
      on the ground-floor, and it seemed to me that, at the sound of my horse's
      feet, some one had come out of them to pass up the stone stairs that led
      to Graham's quarters. As I slipped out of the saddle the sound of a
      distant cannon broke the silence of the night, and my horse, despite his
      forty miles accomplished in little more than five hours, pricked up his
      ears. I tied him up, and instead of going to my own rooms went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Watson was standing in the first room I entered. The quick tropic
      dawn had come, and I saw the face of a woman who had not slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Graham's servant told me that he was ill. I have&mdash;a&mdash;a
      right to know how he is, and where he is,&rdquo; she said with her imperturbable
      self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Graham is at the front,&rdquo; I answered, and the sound of the cannon, dull
      and distant, finished the sentence for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bertha Watson bit her lip to hide its quivering, and looked at me,
      breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have rung up the curtain,&rdquo; I added, remembering our talk in the
      verandah of the Residency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Across my saddle in a state of insensibility, which passed off, as I
      expected it would, an hour before the time fixed for the storming of the
      fortifications. Some one drugged him in order that he might not take part
      in this action. Some one who feared him&mdash;or for him. Le
      Mesurier-Groselin called me to him, and only we three know of it. I am the
      only medical man connected with the affair, and I can certify that it was
      a native drug that was used, and that therefore a native must have done
      this thing. Probably a native spy, Miss Watson, who, finding out the
      proposed surprise too late to warn the rebels, attempted to disorganize
      the force by this means. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me with all her keen wits in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one would ever dream that another had done it&mdash;say some one who
      was attached to Graham, and who, in a panic, gave way to temptation and
      did him a great wrong, while saving him from danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stood aside as I spoke and motioned her towards the door, for the place
      would soon be astir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And I reckoned you were a fool&mdash;behind that
      single eye-glass. It is not you that is the fool, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly she turned at the head of the stairs and whispered hoarsely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he is killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what he is paid for, Miss Watson. We can only wait and hope that
      he isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Austin Graham was not killed, but came back with, as the Brigadier said,
      the Victoria Cross up his sleeve. I happened to be near Bertha Watson when
      they met, and there was that in her eyes when they encountered his which
      was a revelation to me and makes me realize even now what a lonely man I

    <h2>
      TOMASO'S FORTUNE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk of poor men, Senora&mdash;then you talk of me. See, I have
      nothing but the wits that are under my hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felipe Fortis spread himself out on the trellis-bordered bench of the
      little Venta that stands at the junction of the Valdemosa Road and the new
      road from Miramar to Palma in the island of Majorca.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felipe was, of course, known to be a young man of present position and
      future prospects, or he would not have said such a thing. It was supposed,
      indeed, by some, to be a great condescension that he should stop at the
      little Venta of the Break of Day and take his half of wine on market-days.
      And, of course, there were women who eagerly sought the woman in it, and
      said that Felipe drank the widow Navarro's sour wine to the bright eyes of
      the widow's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck for her,&rdquo; said Rosa's cousins and aunts, who were dotted all
      up the slopes of the valley on either side in their little stone cottages;
      right up from the river to the Val d'Erraha&mdash;that sunny valley of
      repose which lies far above the capital of Majorca, far above the hum of
      life and sound of the restless sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felipe, who was a good-looking young fellow, threw his hat down on the
      bench beside him. He had fair hair and a white skin&mdash;both, he
      understood, much admired by the dark-eyed daughters of the Baleares. He
      shook his finger with a playful condescension at the widow Navarro, with
      whom he was always kind enough to exchange a few light pleasantries. And
      she, womanlike, suited her fire to the calibre of the foe, for she was an
      innkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all&mdash;the wits that are under my hat,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rosa, who was standing in the deep shadow of the doorway, muttered to
      herself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are indeed a poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Felipe glanced towards her, and wondered whether the sun was shining
      satisfactorily through the trellis on his fair hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa looked at him with inscrutable eyes&mdash;deep as velvet, grave and
      meditative. She was slight and girlish, with dull blue-black hair, and a
      face that might have been faithfully cut on a cameo. It was the colour of
      a sun-burnt peach, and usually wore that air of gentle pride which the
      Moors seem to have left behind them in those lands through which they
      passed, to the people upon whom they have impressed an indelible mark. But
      when she smiled, which was not often, her lips tilted suddenly at the
      corners in a way to make an old man young and a young man mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomaso of the Mill, who sat on the low wall across the road in the shadow
      of a great fig-tree, was watching with steady eyes. Tomaso was always
      watching Rosa. He had watched for years. She had grown up under that
      steady eye. And now, staring into the deep shadow of the cottage interior,
      he thought that he saw Rosa smile upon Felipe. And Felipe, of course,
      concluded that she was smiling at him. They all did that. And only Rosa
      knew the words she had whispered respecting the gallant Felipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomaso of the Mill was a poor man if you like, and usually considered a
      dull one to boot. He only had the mill half-way up the hill to the Val
      d'Erraha&mdash;a mill to which no grist came now that there was steam
      communication between Palma and Barcelona, and it paid better to ship the
      produce of the island to the mainland, buying in return the adulterated
      produce of the Barcelona mills. Tomaso's father had been a prosperous man
      almost to the day of his death, but times had moved on, leaving Tomaso and
      his mill behind. And there is no man who watches the times move past him
      with a prouder silence than a Spaniard. The mill hardly brought in ten
      pesetas a month now, and that was from friends&mdash;poor men like himself
      who were yet gentlemen, and found some carefully worded reason why they
      preferred home-milled flour. Tomaso, moreover, was deadly simple: there is
      nothing more fatal than simplicity in these days. It never occurred to him
      to sell his mill, or let it fall in ruins and go elsewhere for work. His
      world had always been bounded on the south by the Val d'Erraha, on the
      north by the Valdemosa road, on the west by the sea, and on the east by
      Rosa. He had never suffered from absolute hunger, and nothing but absolute
      hunger will make a Spaniard leave his home. So Tomaso of the Mill remained
      at the mill, and, like his forefathers, only repaired the sluices and
      conduit when the water-supply was no longer heavy enough to drive the
      creaking wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the death of his mother he had lived alone, cooking his own food,
      washing his own clothes, and no man in the valley wore a whiter shirt. As
      to the food, perhaps there was not too much of it, or it may have been
      badly cooked; for Tomaso had a lean and hungry look, and his tanned cheek
      had diagonal lines drawn from the cheek-bone to the corner of the
      clean-shaven mouth. The lips were firm, the chin was long. It was a solemn
      face that looked out from beneath the shadow of the great fig-tree. And&mdash;there
      was no mistaking it&mdash;it was the face of that which the world calls a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felipe turned towards him in his good-natured grand way, and invited him
      by a jerk of the head to come and partake of his half-bottle of Majorcan
      wine. There was a great gulf between these two men, for Tomaso wore no
      jacket and Felipe was never seen without one. Tomaso therefore accepted
      the invitation with a grave courtesy. Felipe knew his manners also. He
      poured a few drops into his own glass, for fear the cork should have left
      a grain of dust, and then filled his guest's little thick tumbler to the
      brim. They touched glasses gravely and drank, Felipe making a swinging
      gesture towards Rosa in the dark doorway before raising the glass to his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And affairs at the mill?&rdquo; inquired Felipe, with a movement of the hand
      demanding pardon if the subject should be painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wheel is still,&rdquo; replied Tomaso, with that grand air of indifference
      with which Spain must eventually go to the wall. He slowly unrolled and
      re-rolled a cheap cigarette, and sat down on the bench opposite to Felipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felipe looked at him with that bright and good-natured smile which was
      known to be so deadly. He spread out his arms in a gesture of lofty
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you?&rdquo; he asked, with a laugh. &ldquo;It will come&mdash;your
      fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Tomaso smiled gravely. He was quite convinced also, in his simple way,
      that his fortune would come; for it had been predicted by a gipsy from
      Granada at the Trinity Fair on the little crowded market-place at Palma.
      The prediction had caught the popular fancy. Tomaso's poverty, it must be
      remembered, was a proverb all over the island. &ldquo;As poor as Tomaso of the
      Mill,&rdquo; the people said; it being understood that a church mouse failed to
      suggest such destitution. Moreover, the gipsy foretold that Tomaso should
      make his own fortune with his own two hands, which added to the joke, for
      no one in Majorca is guilty of such manual energy as will lead to more
      than a sufficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I say,&rdquo; continued Felipe, turning to the widow with that unconscious
      way of discussing some one who happens to be present which is only
      understood in Southern worlds. &ldquo;Now, I say that when it comes, it will
      have something to do with horses. See how he sits in the saddle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felipe sketched perfection with a little gesture of his brown hand,
      which was generous of Felipe; for Tomaso was (by one of those strange
      chances which lead the Spaniards to say that God gives nuts to those who
      have no teeth) a born horseman, and sat in the saddle like a god&mdash;one
      straight line from heel to shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomaso had risen from the bench and walked slowly across the road to his
      former seat on the low wall. He was a shy and rather modest man, and felt,
      perhaps, that there was a suggestion of condescension in Felipe's
      attitude. If Felipe had come here to pay his addresses to Rosa, he,
      Tomaso, was not the man to put difficulties in the way. For he was one of
      those rare men who, in loving, place themselves in the background. He
      loved Rosa, in a word, better than he loved himself. And in the solitude
      of his life at the mill he had worked out a grim problem in his own mind.
      He had weighed himself carefully in the balance, nothing extenuating. He
      had taken as precise a measure of Felipe Fortis with his present position
      and his future prospects. And, of course, the only solution was that Rosa
      would do well to marry Felipe. So Tomaso withdrew to the outer side of the
      road and the shade of the fig-tree, while Felipe talked gaily with Rosa's
      mother, and Rosa looked on from the doorway with deep, dark eyes that said
      nothing at all. For Felipe was wooing the daughter through the mother, as
      men have often done before him; and the widow smiled on Felipe's suit. The
      whole business, it appeared, was to be conducted in a sane and gentlemanly
      way, over a half of the widow's wine, with clinking glasses and a grave
      politeness. And, of course, Felipe had it all his own way. The question of
      rivalry did not so much as suggest itself to him, so he could the more
      easily be kind to the quiet man with the steady eyes who withdrew with
      such tact when he had finished his wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there was Tomaso's fortune to take into consideration. No one
      seemed to think of doubting that the prediction must eventually come true,
      but it was hardly likely to be verified in time to convert Tomaso into a
      serious rival to Felipe Fortis. There were assuredly no fortunes to be
      made out of the half-ruined mill. The trade had left that for ever. There
      was no money in the whole valley, and Tomaso did not seem disposed to go
      and seek it elsewhere. He passed his time between the mill and the low
      wall opposite the Venta of the Break of Day, of which the stones beneath
      the fig-tree were polished with his constant use of them. He usually came
      down from the mill, which is a mile above the Venta, as any one may prove
      who seeks the Valley of Repose to-day, by the new road recently cut on the
      hillside by a spasmodically active Town Council&mdash;the road from
      Miramar to Palma.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been at one time supposed that Tomaso's fortune would come to him
      through this new road, for the construction of which a portion of the land
      attached to the mill must be purchased. But it was a very small portion,
      and the purchase-money a ridiculous little sum, which was immediately
      swallowed up in repairs to the creaking wheel. The road-makers, however,
      turned aside the stream below the mill, and conducted it to a chasm in the
      rock, where it fell a great height to a tunnel beneath the road. And half
      the valley said they could not sleep for the sound of it, and the other
      half said they liked it. And Rosa, whose bedroom window was nearer to it
      than any other in the valley, said nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting beneath the fig-tree, Tomaso looked up suddenly towards the mill.
      He was so much accustomed to the roar of his own mill-stream that his ears
      never heeded it, and heard through it softer and more distant sounds. He
      heard something now&mdash;the regular beat of trotting horses on the road
      far above his home. He looked up towards the heights, though, of course,
      he could see nothing through the pines, which are thickly planted here and
      almost as large as the pines of Vizzavona, in the island of Corsica. He
      listened to the sound with that quiet interest which comes to those who
      live in constant sunshine, and is in itself nearly akin to indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the widow, noting his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a carriage on the new road&mdash;some traveller from Miramar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Travellers from Miramar were few and far between. None had as yet made use
      of the new road. This was, therefore, a matter of considerable interest to
      the four persons idling away the afternoon at the Venta of the Break of
      Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horses will as likely as not take fright at the new waterfall made by
      these mules of road-makers,&rdquo; said Tomaso, rising slowly and throwing away
      the end of his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his stand in the middle of the road, looking uphill with a gleam
      of interest in his eyes. He knew horses so well that his opinion arrested
      the attention of his hearers. Tomaso had always said that the diversion of
      his mill-stream would be dangerous to the traffic on the new road. But it
      was nobody's business to consult Tomaso.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the middle of the road, contemplatively biting his lower lip&mdash;a
      lean, lithe man, who had lived a clean and simple life&mdash;and never
      dreamt that this might be his fortune trotting down the new Miramar road
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steady pace was suddenly broken, and at the same moment the hollow
      roar of the wheels told that the carriage was passing over the little
      tunnel through which the stream escaped to the valley below. Then came the
      clatter of frightened horses and the broken cry of one behind them. Felipe
      leapt to his feet and stood irresolute. The widow gave a little cry of
      fear, and Rosa came out into the sunlight. There the three stood, rigid,
      watching Tomaso contemplatively biting his lip in the middle of the
      sun-lit road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the suspense was over&mdash;the worst was realized. A carriage
      swung round the corner a quarter of a mile higher up the road, with two
      horses stretched at a frantic gallop, and the driver had no reins in his
      hand; for his reins had broken, and the loose ends fluttered on either
      side. He was stooping forward, with his right hand at the screw-brake
      between his legs, and in his left hand he swung his heavy whip. He was a
      brave man, at all events, for he kept his nerve and tried to guide the
      horses with his whip. There was just a bare chance that he might reach the
      Venta, but below it&mdash;not a hundred yards below it&mdash;the road
      turned sharply to the right, and everything failing to take that sharp
      turn would leap into space and the rocky bed of the river five hundred
      feet below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gave a shout as he came round the corner, and to his credit it was
      always remembered that his gesture waved Tomaso aside. But Tomaso stood in
      the middle of the road, and his steady eyes suddenly blazed with a fierce
      excitement. His lips were apart. He was breathless, and Rosa found herself
      with her two hands at her throat, watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage seemed to bear right down upon him, but he must have stepped
      aside, for it passed on and left the road clear. Tomaso was somewhat in
      the dust, in the confusion of tossing heads and flying reins. Then his
      white shirt appeared against the black of the horses' manes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name of God!&rdquo; cried Felipe; &ldquo;he is on top!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Felipe Fortis forgot his fine clothes and superior manners. He was out
      on the road in an instant, running as he never ran before, and shouting a
      hundred Catalonian oaths which cannot be transcribed here, even in
      Catalonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to see what happened during these moments which were just
      those instants of time in which one man does well and another badly. But
      Rosa and her mother saw at length that Tomaso was apparently half standing
      on the pole between the two horses. He was swinging and jerking from side
      to side, but all the while he was gathering the scattered reins in his
      hands. Then suddenly he threw himself back, and the horses' heads went up
      as if they were being strangled. They jerked and tugged in vain. Tomaso's
      arms were like steel. Already the pace was slackening&mdash;the gallop was
      broken. And a minute later the carriage was at a standstill in the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the driver was on the ground explaining excitedly to Tomaso how it
      had happened, and Tomaso was smiling gravely as he wiped some blood from
      his hand. It was Felipe who, arriving at this moment, thought of opening
      the carriage-door. There was a pause while Felipe looked into the
      carriage, and Rosa and her mother ran towards him. Rosa helped Felipe to
      assist an old man to alight. He was a very fat man, with grey and flaccid
      cheeks, with shiny black hair and a good deal of gold chain and ring about
      him. He seemed only half-conscious of the assistance proffered to him, and
      walked slowly across the road to the shade of the trees. Here he sat down
      on the low wall, with his elbows on his knees, his two hands to his head,
      and looked thoughtfully at the ground between his feet. It was precisely
      the attitude of one who has had a purler at football. And the others
      looked on in the waiting silence which usually characterizes such moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman is not hurt?&rdquo; suggested Felipe, who was always affable and
      ready with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the gentleman was not prepared to confirm this optimistic view of the
      case. He simply sat staring at the ground between his feet. At length he
      lifted his head and looked Felipe slowly up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who stopped the horses?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A man in a white shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Tomaso of the Mill,&rdquo; answered the widow, who would have spoken
      sooner if she had had her breath. &ldquo;He washes his own,&rdquo; she added, anxious
      to say a good word for a neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomaso should, of course, have come forward and bowed. But Tomaso's
      manners were not of a showy description. He was helping the driver to
      repair the reins, and paused at this moment to remove the perspiration
      from his forehead with two fingers, which he subsequently wiped on the
      seam of his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; cried the fat man sitting on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      One could see that he was a business man; for he had the curt manner of
      the counting-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, Tomaso!&rdquo; added the widow Navarro, in a shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tomaso came slowly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; said the man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomaso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomaso what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomaso of the Mill.&rdquo; And his face fell a little when the fat man produced
      a pocket-book and wrote the name down with a shaking hand. The action
      rather savoured of the police and the law, and Tomaso did not like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout man leant forward with his chin in the palm of his hand and
      reflected for some moments. He was singularly reflective, and seemed to be
      making a mental calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said at length, looking at Tomaso with quick business-like
      eyes. He was beginning to recover his colour now. &ldquo;See here, I am not
      going to give you money&mdash;between gentlemen, eh! such things are not
      done. You have saved my life. Good! You are a brave man, and you risked
      your neck for a perfect stranger! I happen to be a rich man, and my life
      is of some value. I came from Barcelona to Majorca on business&mdash;business
      with a good profit. If I had gone over there&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and jerked
      his thumb towards the blue and hazy space that lay below them&mdash;&ldquo;the
      transaction would have fallen through. You have enabled me, by your prompt
      action, to return to Palma this evening and sign the papers connected with
      this affair. Good! You are therefore entitled to a commission on the
      profit that I shall make. I have reckoned it out. It amounts to ten
      thousand pesetas&mdash;a modest fortune, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tomaso nodded his head. He had always known that it would come. The widow
      Navarro threw up her eyes, and in a whisper called the attention of her
      own special black-letter saint to this business. Rosa was glancing
      surreptitiously at Felipe, who, to do him justice, was smiling on the old
      man with much appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what I am,&rdquo; continued the man of business, tapping his exuberant
      waistcoat; &ldquo;I am fat and I am sixty-seven. When I return to Palma, I shall
      notify to a lawyer that I leave to you, 'Tomaso of the Mill,' ten thousand
      pesetas, to be paid as soon after my death as possible. At Barcelona I
      shall put the matter into legal form with my own notary there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his seat on the wall and held out his thick white hand, which
      Tomaso took, and they shook hands gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As between gentlemen, eh?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;as between gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he walked slowly to the other side of the road, where the driver was
      engaged in drawing his carriage out of the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will enter your malediction of a carriage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you must lead
      the horses to the bottom of the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage went slowly on its way, while the others, after watching it
      turn the corner, returned to the Venta. In the twinkling of an eye
      Tomaso's fortune had come. And he had won it with his own hands, precisely
      as the gipsy from Granada had predicted. The tale, moreover, is true, and
      any one can verify it who will take the trouble to go to Palma de
      Mallorca, where half a dozen independent witnesses heard the prediction
      made at a stall in the crowded and narrow market-place nearly six months
      before the new Miramar road was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was getting dusk, Felipe Fortis mounted his horse and rode on to his
      home in the valley far down the Valdemosa road. And Tomaso, with his
      handkerchief bound round his hand, walked thoughtfully up to his solitary
      home. The great problem which he had thought out so carefully and brought
      to so grim and certain a conclusion had suddenly been reopened. And Rosa
      had noticed with the quickness of her sex that Tomaso had carefully
      avoided looking at her from the moment that his good fortune had been made
      known. His manner, as he bade mother and daughter a gruff good-night was
      rather that of a malefactor than one who had just done a meritorious
      action, and Rosa watched him go with an odd little wise smile tilting the
      corners of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodnight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&mdash;and your fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Tomaso turned the words over and over in his mind a hundred times, and
      could make nothing of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa was early astir the next morning, and happened to be at the open door
      when Tomaso came down the road. He was wearing his best hat&mdash;a
      flat-brimmed black felt&mdash;which, no doubt, the girl noticed, for it is
      by the piecing together of such trifles that women hold their own in this
      world. There was otherwise no change in Tomaso's habiliments, which
      consisted, as usual, of dark trousers, a white shirt, and a dark-blue faja
      or waistcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; cried Rosa, stepping out into the sunlight with a
      haste called forth, perhaps, by the suspicion that Tomaso would fain have
      passed by unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, his bronzed face a deeper red, his steady eyes wavering for
      once. But he did not come towards the Venta, which stands on the higher
      side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down to Palma&mdash;to make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of your fortune?&rdquo; inquired Rosa, looking at the cup she was drying with
      the air of superior knowledge which so completely puzzled the simple
      Tomaso.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, slowly turning on his heel as if to continue his
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have made sure of your precious fortune?&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had raised her hand to her hair, and was standing in a very pretty,
      indifferent attitude. Tomaso held his lower lip between his teeth as he
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I shall do with it,&rdquo; he answered, and, turning, he
      walked hurriedly down the sun-lit road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in on your way back and tell us about it,&rdquo; she called out after him,
      and then stood watching him until he turned the corner where he had picked
      up his fortune on the road the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of the man that he never turned to look at her, and
      the girl gave a little nod of the head as he disappeared. She had
      apparently expected him not to look back, and yet wanted him to do it, and
      at the same time would rather he did not do it. Felipe Fortis would have
      turned half a dozen times, with a salutation and a wave of the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sun went down behind the tableland of the Val d'Erraha and Tomaso
      did not return. Then the moon rose, large and yellow, beyond the Valdemosa
      Heights, and the widow Navarro, her day's work done, walked slowly up the
      road to visit her sister, the road-keeper's wife. Rosa sat on the bench
      beneath the trellis, and thought those long thoughts that belong to youth.
      She heard Tomaso's step long before he came in sight, for the valley is
      thinly populated and as still as Sahara. He was walking slowly, and
      dragged his feet as if fatigued. The moon was now well up, and the girl
      could distinguish Tomaso's gleaming white shirt as he turned the corner.
      As he approached he kept on the left-hand side of the road. It was evident
      that he intended to call at the Venta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;Tomaso!&rdquo; cried Rosa, when he was almost at the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;Rosa!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all alone,&rdquo; said Rosa. &ldquo;Mother has gone to see Aunt Luisa. Have you
      your fortune in your pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came up the steps and leant against the trellis, looking down at her.
      She could not see his face, but a woman does not always need to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it&mdash;Tomaso?&rdquo; she asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That poor man,&rdquo; he explained simply&mdash;for the Spaniards hold human
      life but cheaply&mdash;&ldquo;was found dead in his carriage when they reached
      Palma. The doctors say it was the shock&mdash;and he so fat. At all events
      he is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosa crossed herself mechanically, and devoutly thought first of all of
      the merchant's future state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His last action was a good one,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is that to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tomaso, in a queer voice. And at the sound Rosa looked up at
      him sharply; but she could see nothing, for his face was in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for you,&rdquo; she said tentatively, &ldquo;you will get your fortune all the
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never get it at all,&rdquo; answered Tomaso, with a curt laugh. &ldquo;I went
      down to Palma this morning with my head full of plans&mdash;in the
      sunshine. I came back with an empty brain&mdash;in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless, looking down at her. They are slow of tongue in
      Majorca, and Rosa reflected for quite a minute before she spoke&mdash;which
      is saying a good deal for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said at length, gently, &ldquo;why is it that you will not get
      your fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to the notary and told him what had happened, what the merchant
      had said, and who had heard him&mdash;and the notary laughed. 'Where is
      your paper?' he asked; and, of course, I had no paper. I went to another
      notary, and at last I saw the Alcalde. 'You should have asked for a paper
      properly signed,' he said. But no gentleman could have asked for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Rosa, rather doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the driver of the carriage,&rdquo; continued Tomaso, &ldquo;and took him to
      the Alcalde, but that was no better. The Alcalde and the notaries laughed
      at us. Such a story, they said, would make any lawyer laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is Felipe Fortis, who heard it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Tomaso, in a hollow voice, &ldquo;there is Felipe Fortis. He was
      in Palma, and I found him at the cafe. But he said he had not time to come
      to the Alcalde with me then, and he was sure that if he did it would be
      useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and walked to the edge of the terrace, looking down into the
      moonlit valley in silence for some minutes. Then she came slowly back, and
      stood before him looking up into his face. He was head and shoulders above
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your fortune is gone?&rdquo; she said. And the moonlight shining on her face
      betrayed the presence of that fleeting wise smile which Tomaso had noticed
      more than once with wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is gone. And there is an end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; asked Rosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;of everything,&rdquo; replied Tomaso, with a grim stoicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosa stood looking at him for a moment. Then she took two deliberate steps
      forward and leant against him just as he was leaning against the trellis,
      as if he had been a tree or something solid and reliable of that sort. She
      laid her cheek, of a deeper colour than a sunburnt peach, against his
      white shirt. In a sort of parenthesis of thought she took a sudden,
      half-maternal interest in the middle button of his shirt, tested it, and
      found it more firmly fixed than she had supposed. Her dusky hair just
      brushed his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are nothing but a stupid,&rdquo; she said.

    <p>
      It was nearly half-past eight when the Grandhaven ran into a fog-bank, and
      the second officer sent a message to the captain's steward, waiting at
      that great man's dinner-table in the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's steward was a discreet man. He gave the message in a whisper
      as he swept the crumbs from the table with a jerk of his napkin. The
      second officer could not, of course, reduce speed on his own
      responsibility. The Grandhaven had been running through fog-banks ever
      since she left Plymouth in the grey of a November afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every Atlantic traveller knows the Grandhaven. She was so well known that
      every berth was engaged despite the lateness of the season. It was
      considered a privilege to sail with Captain Dixon, the most popular man on
      the wide seas. A few millionaires considered themselves honoured by his
      friendship. One or two of them called him Tom on shore. He was an
      Englishman, though the Grandhaven was technically an American ship. His
      enemies said that he owed his success in life to his manners, which
      certainly were excellent. Not too familiar with any one at sea, but
      unerringly discriminating between man and man, between a real position and
      an imaginary one. For, in the greatest Republic the world has yet seen,
      men are keenly alive to social distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, his friends pointed to his record. Captain Dixon had
      never made a mistake in seamanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a handsome man, with a trim brown beard cut to a point in the naval
      style, gay blue eyes, and a bluff way of carrying his head. The lady
      passengers invariably fell into the habit of describing him as a splendid
      man, and the word seemed to fit him like a glove. Nature had certainly
      designed him to be shown somewhere in the front of life, to be placed upon
      a dais and looked up to and admired by the multitude. She had written
      success upon his sunburnt face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thousands of friends. Every seat at his table was booked two
      voyages ahead, and he knew the value of popularity. He was never carried
      off his feet, but enjoyed it simply and heartily. He had fallen in love
      one summer voyage with a tall and soft-mannered Canadian girl, a Hebe with
      the face of a Madonna, with thoughtful, waiting blue eyes. She was only
      nineteen, and, of course, Captain Dixon carried everything before him. The
      girl was astonished at her good fortune; for this wooer was a king on his
      own great decks. No princess could be good enough for him, had princesses
      been in the habit of crossing the Atlantic. Captain Dixon had now been
      married some years.
    </p>
    <p>
      His marriage had made a perceptible change in the personnel of his
      intimates. A bachelor captain appeals to a different world. He was still a
      great favourite with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Grandhaven had only been one night at sea, the captain's
      table had no vacant seats. These were all old travellers, and there had
      been libations poured to the gods, now made manifest by empty bottles and
      not a little empty laughter. Dixon, however, was steady enough. He had
      reluctantly accepted one glass of champagne from the bottle of a Senator
      powerful in shipping circles. He and his officers made a point of drinking
      water at table. The modern sailor is one of the startling products of
      these odd times. He dresses for dinner, and when off duty may be found
      sitting on the saloon stairs discussing with a lady passenger the
      respective merits of Wagner and Chopin as set forth by the ship's band,
      when he ought to be asleep in bed in preparation for the middle watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain received the message with a curt nod. But he did not rise from
      the table. He knew that a hundred eyes were upon him, watching his every
      glance. If he jumped up and hurried from the table, the night's rest of
      half a hundred ladies would inevitably suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his watch from his pocket and rose, laughing at some sally made by
      a neighbour. As he passed down the length of the saloon, he paused to
      greet one and exchange a laughing word with another. He was a very
      gracious monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On deck it was wet and cold. A keen wind from the north-west seemed to
      promise a heavy sea and a dirty night when the Lizard should be passed and
      the protection of the high Cornish moorlands left behind. The captain's
      cabin was at the head of the saloon stairs. Captain Dixon lost no time in
      changing his smart mess-jacket for a thicker coat. Oilskins and a
      sou'wester transformed him again to the seaman that he was, and he climbed
      the narrow iron ladder into the howling darkness of the upper bridge with
      a brisk readiness to meet any situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog-bank was a thick one. It was like a sheet of wet cotton-wool laid
      upon the troubled breast of the sea. The lights at the forward end of the
      huge steamer were barely visible. There was no glare aloft where the
      masthead light stared unwinking into the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixon exchanged a few words with the second officer, who stood, rather
      restless, by the engine-room telegraph. They spoke in monosyllables. The
      dial showed &ldquo;Full speed ahead.&rdquo; Captain Dixon stood chewing the end of his
      golden moustache, which he had drawn in between his teeth. He looked
      forward and aft and up aloft in three quick movements of the head. Then he
      laid his two hands on the engine-room telegraph and reduced the pace to
      half-speed. There were a hundred people on board who would take note of it
      with a throb of uneasiness at their hearts, but that could not be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second officer stepped sideways into the chart-room, reluctant to turn
      his eyes elsewhere than dead ahead into the wind and mist, to make a note
      in two books that lay open on the table under the shaded electric lamp. It
      was twenty minutes to nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grandhaven was a quick ship, but she was also a safe one. The captain
      had laid a course close under the Lizard lights. He intended to alter it,
      but not yet. The mist might lift. There was plenty of time, for by dead
      reckoning they could scarcely hope to sight the twin lights before eleven
      o'clock. The captain turned and said a single word to his second officer,
      and a moment later the great fog-horn above them in the darkness coughed
      out its deafening note of warning. A dead silence followed. Captain Dixon
      nodded his head with a curt grunt of satisfaction. There was nothing near
      them. They could carry on, playing their game of blindman's-buff with
      Fate, open-eared, steady, watchful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no music to-night, though the band had played the cheeriest
      items of its repertoire outside the saloon door during dinner. Many of the
      passengers were in their cabins already, for the Grandhaven was rolling
      gently on the shoulder of the Atlantic swell. The sea was heavy, but not
      so heavy as they would certainly encounter west of the Land's End.
      Presently the Grandhaven crept out into a clear space, leaving the
      fog-bank in rolling clouds like cannon-smoke behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Captain Dixon, with a sigh of relief; he had never been really
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the second officer, ruddy and glistening with wet, lighted up
      suddenly, and sundry lines around his eyes were wiped away as if by the
      passage of a sponge as he stooped over the binnacle. Almost at once his
      face clouded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another light ahead,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Hang them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave a short laugh to reassure his subordinate, whom he knew
      to be an anxious, careful man, on his promotion. Captain Dixon was always
      self-confident. That glass of champagne from the Senator's hospitable
      bottle made him feel doubly capable to-night to take his ship out into the
      open Atlantic, and then to bed with that easy heart which a skipper only
      knows on the high seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he turned to look sharply at his companion, whose eyes were fixed
      on the fog-bank, which was now looming high above the bows. There were
      stars above them, but no moon would be up for another three hours. Dixon
      seemed to be about to say something, but changed his mind. He raised his
      hands to the ear-flaps of his sou'wester, and, loosening the string under
      his chin, pushed the flannel lappets up within the cap. The second officer
      wore the ordinary seafaring cap known as a cheese-cutter. He was much too
      anxious a man to cover his ears even in clear weather, and said, with his
      nervous laugh, that the colour did not come out of his hair, if any one
      suggested that the warmer headgear would protect him from rain and spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixon stood nearer to his companion, and they stood side by side, looking
      into the fog-bank, which was now upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any dogs on board?&rdquo; he asked casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought I heard a little bell; such a thing as a lady's lap-dog wears
      round his neck on a ribbon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second officer turned and glanced sharply up at the captain, who,
      however, made no further comment, and seemed to be thinking of something
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't have been a bell-buoy, I suppose?&rdquo; he suggested, with a
      tentative laugh as he pushed his cap upwards away from his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No bell-buoys out here,&rdquo; replied the captain, rather sharply, with his
      usual self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood side by side in silence for five minutes or more. The mist was
      a little thinner now, and Captain Dixon looked upwards to the sky, hoping
      to see the stars. He was looking up when the steamer struck, and the shock
      threw him against the after rail of the bridge. The second officer was
      thrown to the ground and struggled there for an instant before getting to
      his feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God Almighty!&rdquo; he said, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dixon was already at the engine-room telegraph wrenching the
      pointer round to full speed ahead. The quartermaster on watch was at his
      side in a moment, and several men in shining oilskins swarmed up the
      ladder to the bridge for their orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grandhaven was quite still now, but trembling like a horse that had
      stumbled badly and recovered itself with dripping knees. Already the seas
      were beating the bluff sides of the great vessel, throwing pyramids of
      spray high above the funnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Dixon grabbed the nearest man by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boats,&rdquo; he shouted in his ear. &ldquo;Tell Mr. Stoke to take charge. Tell
      him it's the Manacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be no danger, for the ship was quite steady, with level
      decks. Turning to another quartermaster, Dixon gave further orders clearly
      and concisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her at that,&rdquo; he said to the second officer, indicating the dial of
      the engine-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; he shouted to the two steersmen who were preparing
      to quit the wheelhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Captain Dixon had never made a mistake in seamanship he must have
      thought out the possibilities of this mistake in all their bearings. For
      the situation was quite clear and compact in his mind. The orders he gave
      came in their proper sequence and were given to the right men.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the decks beneath arose a confused murmur like the stirring of bees
      in an overturned hive. Then a sharp order in one voice, clear and strong,
      followed by a dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Stoke has got 'em in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and looked sharply fore and aft and up above him at the
      towering funnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is heeling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Martin, she's heeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ship was slowly turning on her side, like some huge and stricken dumb
      animal laying itself down to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the captain with a bitter laugh, to the two steersmen who had
      come a second time to the threshold of the wheel-house, &ldquo;yes, you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the engine-room telegraph and rang the &ldquo;Stand by.&rdquo; But there
      was no answer. The engineers had come on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got to go,&rdquo; said Martin, the second officer, deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better follow them,&rdquo; replied the captain, with a jerk of his head
      towards the ladder down which the two steersmen had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, be d&mdash;d,&rdquo; said Martin. &ldquo;My place is here.&rdquo; There was no
      nervousness about the man now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmur on the decks had suddenly risen to shrieks and angry shouts.
      Some were getting ready to die in a most unseemly manner. They were
      fighting for the boats. The clear, strong voice had ceased giving orders.
      It afterwards transpired that the chief officer, Stoke, was engaged at
      this time on the sloping decks in tying lifebelts round the women and
      throwing them overboard, despite their shrieks and struggles. The
      coastguards found these women strewn along the beach like wreckage below
      St. Keverne&mdash;some that night, some at dawn&mdash;and only two were
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain snapped his finger and thumb, a gesture of annoyance which was
      habitual to him. Martin knew the meaning of the sound, which he heard
      through the shouting and the roar of the wind and the hissing of a cloud
      of steam. He placed his hand on the deck of the bridge as if to feel it.
      He had only to stretch out his arm to touch the timbers, for the vessel
      was lying over farther now. There was no vibration beneath his hand; the
      engines had ceased to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dixon, who was holding to the rail in front of him with both
      hands. &ldquo;Yes, she has got to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke the Grandhaven slid slowly backwards and sideways into the
      deep water. The shrieks were suddenly increased, and then died away in a
      confused gurgle. Martin slid down on to the captain, and together they
      shot into the sea. They sank through a stratum of struggling limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village of St. Keverne lies nearly two miles from the sea, high above
      it on the bare tableland that juts out ten miles to the Lizard lights. It
      is a rural village far from railway or harbour. Its men are
      agriculturists, following the plough and knowing but little of the sea,
      which is so far below them that they rarely descend to the beach, and they
      do no business in the great waters. But their churchyard is full of
      drowned folk. There are one hundred and four in one grave, one hundred and
      twenty in another, one hundred and six in a third. An old St. Keverne man
      will slowly name thirty ships and steamers wrecked in sight of the church
      steeple in the range of his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick-eared coastguard heard the sound of the escape of steam, which was
      almost instantly silenced. Then he heard nothing more. He went back to the
      station and made his report. He was so sure of his own ears that he took a
      lantern and went down to the beach. There he found nothing. He stumbled on
      towards Cadgwith along the unbroken beach. At times he covered his lantern
      and peered out to sea, but he saw nothing. At last something white caught
      his eye. It was half afloat amid the breakers. He went knee-deep and
      dragged a woman to the shore; she was quite dead. He held his lantern
      above his head and stared out to sea. The face of the water was flecked
      with dark shadows and white patches. He was alone, two miles from help up
      a steep combe and through muddy lanes, and as he turned to trudge towards
      the cliffs his heart suddenly leapt to his throat. There was some one
      approaching him across the shingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong deep voice called to him, with command and a certain resolution
      in its tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, a coastguard?&rdquo; it asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man came up to him and gave him orders to go to the nearest village
      for help, for lanterns and carts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ship?&rdquo; asked the coastguard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandhaven, London, New Orleans,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Hurry, and bring as
      many men as you can. Got a boat about here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one on the beach half a mile along to the south'ard. But you
      cannot launch her through this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coastguard glanced at the man with a sudden interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoke&mdash;first mate,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the story of the wreck has been told by abler pens in the
      daily newspapers. How forty-seven people were saved; how the lifeboat from
      Cadgwith picked up some, floating insensible on the ebbing tide with
      lifebuoys tied securely round them; how some men proved themselves great,
      and some women greater; how a few proved themselves very contemptible
      indeed; how the quiet chief officer, Stoke, obeyed his captain's orders to
      take charge of the passengers;&mdash;are not these things told by the
      newspapers? Some of them, especially the halfpenny ones, went further, and
      explained to a waiting world how it had all come about, and how easily it
      might have been avoided. They, moreover, dealt out blame and praise with a
      liberal hand, and condemned the owners or exonerated the captain with the
      sublime wisdom which illumines Fleet Street. One and all agreed that
      because the captain was drowned he was not to blame, a very common and
      washy sentiment which appealed powerfully to the majority of their
      readers. Some of the newspapers, while agreeing that the first officer,
      having saved many lives by his great exertions during the night, and
      perfect organization for relief and help the next day, had made for
      himself an immortal name, hinted darkly that the captain's was the better
      part, and that they preferred to hear in such cases that all the officers
      had perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke despatched the surviving passengers by train from Helston back to
      London. They were not enthusiastic about him, neither did they subscribe
      to present him with a service of plate. They thought him stern and
      unsympathetic. But before they had realized quite what had happened they
      were back at their homes or with their friends. Many of the dead were
      recovered, and went to swell the heavy crop of God's seed sown in St.
      Keverne churchyard. It was Stoke who organized these quiet burials, and
      took a careful note of each name. It was he to whom the friends of the
      dead made their complaint or took their tearful reminiscences, to both of
      which alike he gave an attentive hearing emphasized by the steady gaze of
      a pair of grey-blue eyes which many remembered afterwards without knowing
      why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; said the director of the great steamship company in
      London. &ldquo;Stoke is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they sent him money, and left him in charge at St. Keverne. The
      newspaper correspondents hurried thither, and several of them described
      the wrong man as Stoke, while others, having identified him, weighed him,
      and found him wanting in a proper sense of their importance. There was no
      &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in him, they said. He had no conception of the majesty of the
      Press.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the survivors were all sent home and the dead thrown up by the
      sea were buried. Martin, the second officer, was among these. They found
      the captain's pilot-jacket on the beach. He must have made a fight for his
      life, and thrown aside his jacket for greater ease in swimming.
      Twenty-nine of the crew, eleven passengers, and a stewardess were never
      found. The sea would never give them up now until that day when she shall
      relinquish her hostages&mdash;mostly Spaniards and English&mdash;to come
      from the deep at the trumpet call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke finished his business in St. Keverne and took the train to London.
      Never an expansive man, he was shut up now as the strong are shut up by a
      sorrow. The loss of the Grandhaven left a scar on his heart which time
      could not heal. She had come to his care from the builder's yard. She had
      never known another husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was free now&mdash;free to turn to the hardest portion of his task. He
      had always sailed with Dixon, his life-long friend. They had been boys
      together, had forced their way up the ladder together, had understood each
      other all through. His friend's wife, by virtue of her office perhaps, had
      come nearer to this man's grim and lonely heart than any other woman. He
      had never defined this feeling; he had not even gone back to its source as
      a woman would have done, or he might have discovered that the gentle air
      of question or of waiting in her eyes which was not always there, but only
      when he looked for it, had been there long ago on a summer voyage before
      she was Captain Dixon's wife at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through his long swim to shore, all through the horrors of that
      November night and the long-drawn pain of the succeeding days, he had done
      his duty with a steady impassiveness which was in keeping with the square
      jaw, the resolute eyes, the firm and merciful lips of the man; but he had
      only thought of Mary Dixon. His one thought was that this must break her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this thought that made him hard and impassive. In the great office
      in London he was received gravely. With a dull surprise he noted a quiver
      in the lips of the managing director when he shook hands. The great
      business man looked older and smaller and thinner in this short time, for
      it is a terrible thing to have to deal in human lives, even if you are
      paid heavily for so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be an official inquiry&mdash;you will have to face it, Stoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, almost indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is Dixon's wife. You will have to go and see her. I have been.
      She stays at home and takes her punishment quietly, unlike some of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And two hours later he was waiting for Mary Dixon in the little
      drawing-room of the house in a Kentish village which he had helped Dixon
      to furnish for her. She did not keep him long, and when she came into the
      room he drew a sharp breath; but he had nothing to say to her. She was
      tall and strongly made, with fair hair and delicate colouring. She had no
      children, though she had been married six years, and Nature seemed to have
      designed her to be the mother of strong, quiet men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke looked into her eyes, and immediately the expectant look came into
      them. There was something else behind it, a sort of veiled light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was kind of you to come so soon,&rdquo; she said, taking a chair by the
      fireside. There was only one lamp in the room, and its light scarcely
      reached her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all the good he did in coming it would seem that he might as well
      have stayed away, for he had no comfort to offer her. He drew forward a
      chair and sat down with that square slowness of movement which is natural
      to the limbs of men who deal exclusively with Nature and action, and he
      looked into the fire without saying a word. Again it was she who spoke,
      and her words surprised the man, who had only dealt with women at sea,
      where women are not seen at their best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want you to grieve for me,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;You have enough
      trouble of your own without thinking of me. You have lost your friend and
      your ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a little movement of the lips, and glanced at her slowly, holding
      his lip between his teeth as he was wont to hold it during the moments of
      suspense before letting go the anchors in a crowded roadstead as he stood
      at his post on the forecastle-head awaiting the captain's signal. She was
      the first to divine what the ship had been to him. Her eyes were waiting
      for his. They were alight with a gentle glow, which he took to be pity.
      She spoke calmly, and her voice was always low and quiet. But he was quite
      sure that her heart was broken, and the thought must have been conveyed to
      her by the silent messenger that passes to and fro between kindred minds.
      For she immediately took up his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; she said, rather hurriedly, &ldquo;as if it would break my heart.
      Long ago I used to think it would. I was very proud of him and of his
      popularity. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she said no more. But sat with dreaming eyes looking into the fire.
      After a long pause she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you must not grieve for me,&rdquo; she said, returning persistently to her
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite simple and honest. Hers was that rare wisdom which is given
      only to the pure in heart; for they see through into the soul of man and
      sift out the honest from among the false.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that she had gained her object, for Stoke was visibly relieved.
      He told her many things which he had withheld from other inquirers. He
      cleared Dixon's good name from anything but that liability to error which
      is only human, and spoke of the captain's nerve and steadiness in the hour
      of danger. Insensibly they lapsed into a low-voiced discussion of Dixon as
      of the character of a lost friend equally dear to them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose to take his leave before it was really necessary to go in
      order to catch his train, impatient to meet her eyes&mdash;which were
      waiting for his&mdash;for a moment as they said good-bye, as the man who
      is the slave of a habit waits impatiently for the time when he can give
      way to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home to the rooms he always occupied near his club in London.
      There he found a number of letters which had been sent on from the
      steamship company's offices. The first he opened bore the postmark of St.
      Just in Cornwall. It was from the coastguard captain of that remote
      western station, and it had been originally posted to St. Keverne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;One of your crew or passengers has turned up here
      on foot. He must have been wandering about for nearly a week and is
      destitute. At times his mind is unhinged. He began to write a letter, but
      could not finish it, and gives no name. Please come over and identify him.
      Meanwhile, I will take good care of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoke opened the folded paper, which had dropped from the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Jack,&rdquo; it began. One or two sentences followed, but there was no
      sequence or sense in them. The writing was that of Captain Dixon without
      its characteristic firmness or cohesion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke glanced at his watch and took up his bag&mdash;a new bag hurriedly
      bought in Falmouth&mdash;stuffed full of a few necessities pressed upon
      him by kind persons at St. Keverne when he stood among them in the clothes
      in which he had swum ashore, which had dried upon him during a long
      November night. There was just time to catch the night mail to Penzance.
      Heaven was kind to him and gave him no time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach leaves Penzance at nine in the morning for a two hours' climb
      over bare moorland to St. Just&mdash;a little grey, remote town on the
      western sea. The loneliness of the hills is emphasized here and there by
      the ruin of an abandoned mine. St. Just itself, the very acme of
      remoteness, is yearly diminishing in importance and population, sending
      forth her burrowing sons to those places in the world where silver and
      copper and gold lie hid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coastguard captain was awaiting Stoke's arrival in the little deserted
      square where the Penzance omnibus deposits its passengers. The two men
      shook hands with that subtle and silent fellowship which draws together
      seamen of all classes and all nations. They walked away together in the
      calm speechlessness of Englishmen thrown together on matters of their
      daily business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't pick up at all,&rdquo; said the coastguard captain, at length. &ldquo;Just
      sits mum all day. My wife looks after him, but she can't stir him up. If
      anybody could, she could.&rdquo; And the man walked on, looking straight in
      front of him with a patient eye. He spoke with unconscious feeling. &ldquo;He is
      a gentleman, despite the clothes he came ashore in. Getting across to the
      Southern States under a cloud, as likely as not,&rdquo; he said, presently.
      &ldquo;Some bank manager, perhaps. He must have changed clothes with some
      forecastle hand. They were seaman's clothes, and he had been sleeping or
      hiding in a ditch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to his house, standing apart in the well-kept garden of the
      station. He opened the door of the simply furnished drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a friend come to see you,&rdquo; he said; and, standing aside, he
      invited Stoke by a silent gesture of the head to pass in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was sitting in front of the fire with his back towards the door. He
      did not move or turn his head. Stoke closed the door behind him as he
      entered the room, and went slowly towards the fireplace. Dixon turned and
      looked at him with shrinking eyes, like the eyes of a dog that has been
      beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get out on to the cliffs,&rdquo; he said in a whisper. &ldquo;We cannot talk
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was clean-shaven, and his hair was grizzled at the temples. His face
      looked oddly weak; for he had an irresolute chin, hitherto hidden by his
      smart beard. Few would have recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of reply Stoke went back towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; he said rather curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak until they had passed out beyond the town towards the
      bare tableland that leads to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't face it, Jack, that's the truth,&rdquo; said the captain, at last.
      &ldquo;And if you or any others try to make me, I'll shoot myself. How many was
      it? Tell me quickly, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over a hundred and ninety,&rdquo; replied Stoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked out on to the bare tableland and sat down on a crumbling wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do the papers say? I have not dared to ask for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stoke shrugged his square shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter what they say?&rdquo; answered the man who had never seen
      his own name in the newspapers. Perhaps he failed to understand Dixon's
      point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mary?&rdquo; asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they sat in silence for some minutes. There was a heavy sea running,
      and the rocks round the Land's End were black in a bed of pure white. The
      Longship's lighthouse stood up, a grey shadow in a grey scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Stoke. &ldquo;Be a man and face it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, and the speaker sat staring across the lashed waters
      to the west, his square chin thrust forward, his resolute lips pressed,
      his eyes impassive. There was obviously only one course through life for
      this seaman&mdash;the straight one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is only for Mary's sake,&rdquo; he added at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeping the Gull Lightship east-south-east, and having the South Foreland
      west by north, you should find six fathoms of water at a neap tide,&rdquo;
       muttered Captain Dixon, in a low monotone. His eyes were fixed and far
      away. He was unconscious of his companion's presence, and spoke like one
      talking in his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke sat motionless by him while he took his steamer in imagination
      through the Downs and round the North Foreland. But what he said was
      mostly nonsense, and he mixed up the bearings of the inner and outer
      channels into a hopeless jumble. Then he sat huddled up on the wall and
      lapsed again into a silent dream, with eyes fixed on the western sea.
      Stoke took him by the arm and led him back to the town, this harmless,
      soft-speaking creature who had once been a brilliant man, and had made but
      one mistake at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stoke wrote a long letter to Mary Dixon that afternoon. He took lodgings
      in a cottage outside St. Just, on the tableland that overlooks the sea. He
      told the captain of the coastguards that he had been able to identify this
      man, and had written to his people in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dixon recognized her when she came, but he soon lapsed again into his
      dreamy state of incoherence, and that which made him lose his grip on his
      reason was again the terror of having to face the world as the captain of
      the lost Grandhaven. To humour him they left St. Just and went to London.
      They changed their name to that which Mary had borne before her marriage,
      a French Canadian name, Baillere. A great London specialist held out a dim
      hope of ultimate recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was brought on by some great shock,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stoke. &ldquo;By a great shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bereavement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Stoke, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is years since the loss of the Grandhaven, and her story was long ago
      superseded and forgotten. And the London specialist was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bailleres live now in the cottage westward of St. Just towards the
      sea, where Stoke took lodgings. It was the captain's wish to return to
      this remote spot. Whenever Captain Stoke is in England he spends his brief
      leave of absence in journeying to the forgotten mining town. Baillere
      passes his days in his garden or sitting on the low wall, looking with
      vacant eyes across the sea whereon his name was once a household word. His
      secret is still safe. The world still exonerates him because he was
      drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sits and dreams all day,&rdquo; is the report that Mary always gives to
      Stoke when she meets him in the town square, where the Penzance omnibus,
      the only link with the outer world, deposits its rare passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Stoke once asked her in a moment of unusual expansion, his deep
      voice half muffled with suppressed suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him with that waiting look which he knows to be there, but
      never meets. For he is a hard man&mdash;hard to her, harder to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;I sit beside him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And who shall gauge a woman's dream?

    <h2>
      PUTTING THINGS RIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want Berlyng,&rdquo; he seemed to be saying, though it was difficult to catch
      the words, for we were almost within range, and the fight was a sharp one.
      It was the old story of India frontier warfare; too small a force, and a
      foe foolishly underrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man they had just brought in&mdash;laying him hurriedly on a bed of
      pine-needles, in the shade of the conifers where I had halted my little
      train&mdash;poor Charles Noon of the Sikhs, was done for. His right hand
      was off at the wrist, and the shoulder was almost severed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bent my ear to his lips, and heard the words which sounded like &ldquo;Want
      Berlyng.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had a man called Berlyng in the force&mdash;a gunner&mdash;who was
      round at the other side of the fort that was to be taken before night, two
      miles away at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want Berlyng?&rdquo; I asked slowly and distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon nodded, and his lips moved. I bent my head again till my ear almost
      touched his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have I?&rdquo; he was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long, I'm afraid, old chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips closed with a queer distressed look. He was sorry to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo; he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I knew it was less. I attended to others, thinking all the while of
      poor Noon. His home life was little known, but there was some story about
      an engagement at Poonah the previous warm weather. Noon was rich, and he
      cared for the girl; but she did not return the feeling. In fact, there was
      some one else. It appears that the girl's people were ambitious and poor,
      and that Noon had promised large settlements. At all events, the
      engagement was a known affair, and gossips whispered that Noon knew about
      the some one else, and would not give her up. He was, I know, thought
      badly of by some, especially by the elders, who had found out the value of
      money as regards happiness, or rather the complete absence of its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the end of it all lay on the sheet beneath the pines, and watched
      me with such persistence that I was at last forced to go to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent for Berlyng?&rdquo; he asked, with a breathlessness which I know
      too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I had not sent for Berlyng, and it requires more nerve than I possess
      to tell unnecessary lies to a dying man. The necessary ones are quite
      different, and I shall not think of them when I go to my account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berlyng could not come if I sent for him,&rdquo; I replied soothingly. &ldquo;He is
      two miles away from here trenching the North Wall, and I have nobody to
      send. The messenger would have to run the gauntlet of the enemy's
      earthworks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give the man a hundred pounds who does it,&rdquo; replied Noon, in his
      breathless whisper. &ldquo;Berlyng will come sharp enough if you say it's from
      me. He hates me too much.&rdquo; He broke off with a laugh which made me feel
      sick. &ldquo;Could he get here in time,&rdquo; he asked after a pause, &ldquo;if you sent
      for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied, with my hand inside his soaked tunic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a wounded water-carrier&mdash;a fellow with a stray bullet in his
      hand&mdash;who volunteered to find Berlyng, and then I returned to Noon
      and told him what I had done. I knew that Berlyng could not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and I think he said, &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to put something right,&rdquo; he said, after an effort; &ldquo;I've been a
      blackguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited a little in case Noon wished to repose some confidence in me.
      Things are so seldom put right that it is wise to facilitate such
      intentions. But it appeared obvious that what Noon had to say could only
      be said to Berlyng. They had, it subsequently transpired, not been on
      speaking terms for some months.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was turning away when Noon suddenly cried out in his natural voice,
      &ldquo;There IS Berlyng.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned and saw one of my men, Swearney, carrying in a gunner. It might
      be Berlyng, for the uniform was that of a captain, but I could not see his
      face. Noon, however, seemed to recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed Swearney where to lay his man, close to me alongside Noon, who at
      that moment required all my attention, for he had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Noon recovered, despite the heat, which was tremendous. He lay
      quite still looking up at the patches of blue sky between the dark
      motionless tops of the pine trees. His face was livid under the sunburn,
      and as I wiped the perspiration from his forehead he closed his eyes with
      the abandon of a child. Some men, I have found, die like children going to
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly recovered, and I gave him a few drops of brandy. I thought he
      was dying, and decided to let Berlyng wait. I did not even glance at him
      as he lay, covered with dust and blackened by the smoke of his beloved
      nine-pounders, a little to the left of Noon, and behind me as I knelt at
      the latter's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while his eyes grew brighter, and he began to look about him. He
      turned his head, painfully, for the muscles of his neck were injured, and
      caught sight of the gunner's uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Berlyng?&rdquo; he asked excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dragged himself up and tried to get nearer to Berlyng. And I helped
      him. They were close alongside each other. Berlyng was lying on his back,
      staring up at the blue patches between the pine trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon turned on his left elbow and began whispering into the smoke-grimed
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Berlyng,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;I was a blackguard. I am sorry, old man. I
      played it very low down. It was a dirty trick. It was my money&mdash;and
      her people were anxious for her to marry a rich man. I worked it through
      her people. I wanted her so badly that I forgot I&mdash;was supposed&mdash;to
      be a&mdash;gentleman. I found out&mdash;that it was you&mdash;she cared
      for. But I couldn't make up my mind to give her up. I kept her&mdash;to
      her word. And now it's all up with me&mdash;but you'll pull through and it
      will all&mdash;come right. Give her my&mdash;love&mdash;old chap. You can
      now&mdash;because I'm&mdash;done. I'm glad they brought you in&mdash;because
      I've been able&mdash;to tell you&mdash;that it is you she cares for. You&mdash;Berlyng,
      old chap, who used to be a chum of mine. She cares for you&mdash;God!
      you're in luck! I don't know whether she's told you&mdash;but she told me&mdash;and
      I was&mdash;a d&mdash;d blackguard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His jaw suddenly dropped, and he rolled forward with his face against
      Berlyng's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berlyng was dead when they brought him in. He had heard nothing. Or
      perhaps he had heard and understood&mdash;everything.

    <h2>
      FOR JUANITA'S SAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cartoner, of the Foreign Office, who is still biding his time, is not
      tired of Spain yet&mdash;and it must be remembered that Cartoner knows the
      Peninsula. He began to know it twenty years ago, and his knowledge is
      worthy of the name, inasmuch as it moves with the times. Some day there
      will be a war in Spain, and we shall fight either for or against the Don,
      which exercise Englishmen have already enjoyed more than once. Cartoner
      hopes that it may come in his time, when, as he himself puts it, he will
      be &ldquo;there or thereabouts.&rdquo; Had not a clever man his opportunity when the
      Russian war broke out, and he alone of educated Britons knew the Crimea?
      That clever man had a queer temper, as we all know, and so lost his
      opportunity; but, if he gets it, Cartoner will take his chance coolly and
      steadily enough. In the mean time he is, if one may again borrow his own
      terse expression, &ldquo;by no means nowhere,&rdquo; for in the Foreign Office those
      who know Spain are a small handful; and those who, like Cartoner, can
      cross the Pyrenees and submerge themselves unheeded in the quiet, sleepy
      life of Andalusia, are to be numbered on two fingers, and no more. When a
      question of Spain or of, say, Cuba, arises, a bell is rung in the high
      places of the Foreign Office, and a messenger in livery is despatched for
      Cartoner, who, as likely as not, will be discovered reading El Imparcial
      in his room. It is always pleasant to be able to ring a bell and summon a
      man who knows the difference between Andalusia and Catalonia&mdash;and can
      without a moment's hesitation say where Cuba is and to what Power it
      belongs, such matters not always being quite clear to the comprehension of
      a Cabinet Minister who has been brought up to the exclusive knowledge of
      the Law, or the manufacture of some article of daily domestic consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      While possessing his knowledge in patience, Cartoner naturally takes a
      mean advantage of those in high places who have it not, nor yet the shadow
      of it. About once in six months he says that he thinks he ought to go to
      Spain, and raps out a few technicalities relating to the politics of the
      Peninsula. A couple of days later he sets off for the land of sun and
      sleep with what he calls his Spanish kit in a portmanteau. This he
      purchased in the &ldquo;Sierpe&rdquo; for forty pesetas at a ready-made tailor's,
      where it was labelled &ldquo;Fantasia.&rdquo; It is merely a tweed suit, but, wearing
      it, Cartoner is safe from the reproach that doggeth the step of the
      British tourist abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during one of these expeditions that Cartoner, in his unobtrusive
      way, found himself in Toledo, where, the guide-books tell us, the
      traveller will obtain no fit accommodation. It was evening, and the
      company who patronized the Cafe of the New Gate were mostly assembled at
      small tables in the garden of that house of entertainment. The moon was
      rising over the lower lands across the Tagus, behind the gate which gives
      its name to this cafe. It is very rightly called the New Gate. Did not
      Wemba build it in the sixth century, as he has cheerfully written upon its
      topmost stone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner sat at one of the outside tables, where the hydrangeas, as large
      as a black currant bush, are ranged in square green boxes against the city
      wall. He was thoughtfully sipping his coffee when a man crawled between
      his legs and hid himself like a sick dog between Cartoner's chair and the
      hydrangea trees. The hiding-place was a good one, provided that the
      fugitive had the collusion of whosoever sat in Cartoner's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency would not betray a poor unfortunate,&rdquo; whispered an eager
      voice at Cartoner's elbow, while, with a sang-froid which had been partly
      acquired south of the Pyrenees, the Briton sat and gazed across the Tagus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon what the unfortunate has been after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence while Truth wrestled with the Foe in the shadows of
      the bush in the green box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency is not of Toledo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yet of Spain,&rdquo; replied Cartoner, knowing that it is good to speak the
      truth at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have chased me from Algodor. They on horseback, I running through
      the forest. You will hear them rattling across the bridge soon. If I can
      only lie hidden here until they have ridden on into the town, I can double
      and get away to Barcelona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner was leaning forward on the little tin table, his chin in the palm
      of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not speak too loud,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;especially when the music is
      still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the Cafe of the New Gate had the additional attraction of what the
      proprietor called a concert. The same consisting of a guitar and a
      bright-coloured violin, the latter in the hands of a wandering scoundrel,
      who must have had good in him somewhere&mdash;it peeped out in the lower
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has his Excellency had coffee?&rdquo; inquired the man behind Cartoner's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does any sugar remain? I have not eaten since morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner dropped the two square pieces of sugar over his shoulder, and
      there was a sound of grinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency will not give me up. I can slip a knife into his
      Excellency's liver where I sit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. What have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I killed Emmanuelo Dembaza, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;but why kill Senor Dembaza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it for Juanita's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A queer smile flitted across Cartoner's face. He was a philosopher in his
      way, and knew that such things must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a scoundrel, and had already ruined one poor girl,&rdquo; went on the
      voice from the tree. The cheap violin was speaking about good and bad
      mixed together again&mdash;and to talk aloud was safe. &ldquo;But she was no
      better than she should be&mdash;a tobacco-worker. And tobacco for work or
      pleasure ever ruins a woman, Senor. Look at Seville. But Juanita is
      different. She irons the fine linen. She is good&mdash;as good as his
      Excellency's mother&mdash;and beautiful. Maria! His Excellency should see
      her eyes. You know what eyes some Spanish women have. A history and
      something one does not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cartoner again. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Juanita thought she liked him,&rdquo; went on the voice, bringing its hearer
      suddenly back to Toledo; &ldquo;she thought she liked him until she found him
      out. Then he turned upon her and said things that were not true. Such
      things, Senor, ruin a girl, whether they be true or not&mdash;especially
      if the women begin to talk. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me of it, and we decided that there was nothing to do but kill
      Emmanuelo Dembaza. She kissed me, Excellency, and every time she did that
      I would kill a man if she asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you are taken and sent to prison for, say, twenty years?&rdquo;
       suggested Cartoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Juanita will drown herself. She has sworn it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I do not give you up? If you escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will follow me to Argentina, Excellency; and, Madre de Dios, we shall
      get married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the waiter came up, cigarette in mouth, after the manner of
      Spain, and suggested a second cup of coffee, to which Cartoner assented&mdash;with
      plenty of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you money?&rdquo; asked Cartoner, when they were alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Senor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this world it is no use being a criminal unless you are rich. If you
      are poor you must be honest. That is the first rule of the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am as poor as a street-dog,&rdquo; said the voice, unconcernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would not take a loan as from one gentleman to another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Spanish pride, crouching in the bushes, &ldquo;I could not do
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cartoner reflected for some moments. &ldquo;In the country from which I come,&rdquo;
       he said at length, &ldquo;we have a very laudable reverence for relics and a
      very delicate taste in such matters. If one man shoots another we like to
      see the gun, and we pay sixty centimes to look upon it. There are people
      who make an honest living by such exhibitions. If they cannot get the gun
      they put another in its place, and it is all the same. Now, your knife&mdash;the
      one the Senorita sharpens with a kiss&mdash;in my country it will have its
      value. Suppose I buy it; suppose we say five hundred pesetas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Cartoner's voice was the voice of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for some time, and at last the knife came up handlewise
      between the leaves of the hydrangea. Spanish pride is always ready to shut
      its eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must swear that what you tell me is true and that Juanita will
      join you in Argentina. Honour of a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour of a gentleman,&rdquo; repeated the voice; and the hand of a blacksmith
      came through the leaves, seeking Cartoner's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are turning the lights out,&rdquo; said Cartoner, when the bargain was
      concluded. &ldquo;But I will wait until it is safe to leave you here. Your
      friends the guardia civile do not arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Senor, I think I hear them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the fugitive's ears did not err. For presently a tall man, white with
      dust in his great swinging cloak, stalked suspiciously among the tables,
      looking into each face. He saluted Cartoner, who was better dressed than
      the other frequenters of the Cafe of the New Gate, and passed on. A horrid
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good God will most likely remember that you have done this deed
      to-night,&rdquo; said the voice, with a queer break in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may,&rdquo; answered Cartoner, who was lighting his cigarette before going.
      &ldquo;On the other hand, I may get five years in a Spanish prison.&rdquo;

      AT THE FRONT
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Some one who is not girlish now&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was only yesterday that I saw her. It happened that the string of
      carriages was stopped at that moment, and I went to the door of her
      comfortable-looking barouche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever feel that shoulder,&rdquo; I asked, raising my hat, &ldquo;at the changes
      of the weather, or when it is damp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and looked at me in surprise. Her face had altered little. It
      was the face of a happy woman, despite a few lines, which were not the
      marks left by a life of gaiety and dissipation. They were not quite the
      lines that Time had drawn on the faces of the women in the carriages
      around her. In some ways she looked younger than most of them, and her
      eyes had an expression which was lacking in the gas-wearied orbs of her
      fashionable sisters. It was the shadowy reflection of things seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into my face&mdash;noting the wear and tear that life had left
      there. Then suddenly she smiled and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&mdash;how strange!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed suddenly and laughed with a pretty air of embarrassment which
      was startlingly youthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she went on, in answer to my question; &ldquo;I never feel that shoulder
      now&mdash;thanks to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of questions I wanted to ask her. But I had fallen
      into a habit, years ago, of restraining that inexpedient desire; and she
      did not seem to expect interrogation. Besides, I could see many answers in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You limped just now,&rdquo; she said, leaning towards me with a little grave
      air of sympathy which was quite familiar to me&mdash;like an old friend
      forgotten until seen again. &ldquo;You limped as you crossed the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall limp until the end of the chapter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have been at that work ever since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked past me over the trees of the Park&mdash;as if looking back
      into a bygone period of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come and dine to-morrow night?&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;Fred will
      be... very pleased to see you. And&mdash;I want to show you the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The line of carriages moved on slowly towards the Park gate, and left me
      baring a grizzled old bullet-head in answer to her smile and nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I limped along it all came back to me. A good many years before&mdash;in
      the days when hard work was the salt of life&mdash;I was entrusted with my
      first field hospital. I was sent up to the front by the cleverest surgeon
      and the poorest organizer that ever served the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, that WAS a field hospital! My first! We were within earshot of the
      front&mdash;that is to say, we could hear the platoon firing. And when the
      wounded came in we thought only of patching them up temporarily&mdash;sewing,
      bandaging, and plastering them into travelling order, and sending them
      down to the headquarters at the coast. It was a weary journey across the
      desert, and I am afraid a few were buried on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one morning, I remember, they brought in Boulson, and I saw at once
      that he had come to stay. We could not patch him up and send him off. The
      jolting of the ambulance waggon had done its work, and Boulson was
      insensible when they laid him on one of the field-cots. He remained
      insensible while I got his things off. The wound told its own story. He
      had been at the hand-to-hand work again, and a bayonet never meets a
      broad-headed spear without trouble coming of it. Boulson meant to get on&mdash;consequently
      I had had him before. I had cut his shirt off him before this, and knew
      that it was marked &ldquo;F.L.G.M.,&rdquo; which does not stand for Boulson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boulson's name was not Boulson; but that was not our business at the time.
      We who patch up Thomas Atkins when he gets hurt in the interests of his
      Queen and country are never surprised to find that the initials on his
      underlinen do not tally with those in the regimental books. When the
      military millennium arrives, and ambulance services are perfect, we shall
      report things more fully. Something after this style&mdash;&ldquo;Killed:
      William Jones. Coronet on his razor-case. Linen marked A. de M.F.G.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While I was busy with a sponge, Boulson opened his eyes and recognized me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon got YOU back again,&rdquo; I remarked, with ghastly professional
      cheeriness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled feebly. &ldquo;Must get into the despatches somehow,&rdquo; he answered, and
      promptly fainted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took especial care of Boulson, being mindful of a letter I had received
      while he was recovering from his last wound. It was a long and rambling
      letter, dated from a place on the west coast of Ireland. It was signed
      with a name which surprised me, and the writer, who addressed me as &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
       and mentioned that he was my humble servant, stated that he was Boulson's
      father. At least he said he thought he was Boulson's father&mdash;if
      Boulson was tall and fair, with blue eyes, and a pepper-castor mark on his
      right arm, where a charge of dust-shot had lodged from a horse-pistol.
      There had, he informed me, been family misunderstandings about a foolish
      fancy formed by Boulson for a military career. And Boulson had gone off&mdash;God
      bless him&mdash;like the high-spirited Irishman that he was&mdash;to
      enlist as a private soldier. And then came the news of the serious wound,
      and if there was a God in heaven (which I never doubted), any kindness and
      care that I could bestow upon Boulson would not be forgotten at the last
      reckoning. And more to a like effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Boulson pulled through and was duly sent down to the fine, roomy
      convalescent hospital on the coast, where they have ice, and newspapers,
      and female nurses fresh from Netley.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second wound was, however, a more serious affair. While others came
      and went, Boulson seemed inclined to stay for ever. At all events he
      stayed for ten days, and made no progress worth mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of that time I was sitting at my table writing perversions of
      God's truth to the old gentleman on the west coast of Ireland when I heard
      the rumble of ambulance waggons. I thought that it was only a returned
      empty&mdash;there having been an informal funeral that evening&mdash;so
      hardly disturbed myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, some one came and stood in front of my table outside
      the tent. I looked up, and looked into the face of one of the few women I
      have met who make me believe in love stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; I said, somewhat rudely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg to report myself,&rdquo; she answered quietly. There was a peculiar
      unsteadiness in her eyes. It seemed to me that this woman was labouring
      under great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the Surgeon-Major send you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I volunteered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! I think I ought to have been asked first. This is no place for
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever there is nursing to be done, we can hardly be out of place,&rdquo; she
      answered, with a determination which puzzled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theoretically,&rdquo; I answered; and, seeing that she had arrived, I made a
      shift to find her suitable quarters and get her to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any serious cases?&rdquo; she asked, while unpacking and setting out
      for my inspection sundry stores she had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have Boulson again,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The man you had in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She buried her head in the case, and did not answer for some seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length she did speak, her voice was indifferent and careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly hurt?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She finished unpacking her stores rather hurriedly, and expressed her
      readiness to go round the cots with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not too tired after your journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I should like to begin at once. Please let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took her round, and altogether I was pleased with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a day or two I almost became resigned to her presence, though I hate
      having women anywhere near the action. It is always better to get the
      nasty cases cleaned up before the women see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly came bad news. There was something wrong at the front. Our
      fellows were falling back upon us. A final stand was to be made at our
      position until reinforcements came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sent for Nurse Fielding, and told her to get ready to leave for
      headquarters at once. I was extremely business-like and formal. She was
      neither. That is the worst of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me stay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather stay and be killed than go away and be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That aroused my suspicions. Perhaps they ought to have been aroused
      before; but, then, I am only a man. I saw how the Surgeon-Major had been
      managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she repeated softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on my arm, and did not withdraw it when she found that
      the sleeve was wet with something that was thicker than water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right&mdash;stay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was sorry for it the next day, when we had the old familiar music of the
      bullets overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the morning matters became more serious. The enemy had a gun with
      which they dropped six-pound shot into us. One of these fell on to the
      corner of our hospital where Boulson lay. It tore the canvas, and almost
      closed Boulson's career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nurse Fielding was at him like a terrier, and lifted him bodily from his
      cot. She was one of those largely framed fair women who have strength,
      both physical and mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was carrying him across the tent when I heard the thud of a bullet.
      Nurse Fielding stopped for a moment and seemed to hesitate. She laid
      Boulson tenderly down on the ground, and then fell across him, while the
      blood ran from her cotton bodice over his face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was what I meant when I asked the lady in the barouche at the
      Park gate whether she ever felt that shoulder now. And the man I dine with
      to-night is not called Boulson, but he has a charge of dust-shot&mdash;the
      result of a boyish experiment&mdash;in his right arm.

    <h2>
      THE END OF THE &ldquo;MOOROO&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long can you give us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who asked this question turned his head and looked up through a
      maze of bright machinery. But he did not rise from his recumbent position.
      He was, in fact, lying on his face on a steel-bar grating&mdash;in his
      shirt-sleeves&mdash;his hands black with oil and steel filings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the Mooroo&mdash;far up above on the upper platform&mdash;leant
      his elbow on the steel banister and reflected for exactly two seconds. He
      was in the habit of sleeping and thinking very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that we will be on the rocks in about twenty minutes to half an
      hour&mdash;unless you can get her going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chief engineer muttered something which was not audible above the roar
      of the wind through the rigging and the wash of the green seas that leapt
      over the bulwarks of the well-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; yelled the captain, leaning over the balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it,&rdquo; reiterated the chief, with his head hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all down there&mdash;the whole engineer's staff of the Mooroo&mdash;in
      their shirt-sleeves, lying among the bright steel rods&mdash;busy at their
      craft&mdash;working against time for their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate that the engines should have held good right across the
      Arabian Sea, through the Red Sea, through the trying &ldquo;fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;stand by&rdquo; and &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; of the Canal&mdash;right through to the Pointe
      de Raz light, which was blinking down upon them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship had been got round with difficulty. Her sails, all black with
      coal-dust and the smoke of many voyages, had been shaken out. They served
      to keep the vessel's bluff prow pushing into the gale, but that was all.
      The Mooroo was drifting&mdash;drifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the passengers were at dinner the engines had suddenly stopped, and
      almost before the fact had been realized, the captain, having exchanged
      glances with his officers, was out of the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in the engine-room,&rdquo; said the doctor and the fifth officer&mdash;left
      at table. The engineer had probably stopped to replace a worn washer or
      something similarly simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stewards hurried to and fro with the dishes. And the passengers went
      on eating their last dinner on earth in that sublime ignorance which is
      the prerogative of passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judge Barrowby, who, in view of the captain's vacant chair on her
      left hand, took, as it were, moral command of the ship, was heard to state
      in a loud voice that she had every confidence in the officers and the
      crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Skeen, of the Indian Intelligence, who sat within hearing of Mrs.
      Judge Barrowby, for his own evil ends and purposes, thereafter said that
      he could now proceed with his dinner&mdash;that his appetite was beginning
      to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;if Mrs. Judge Barrowby says that it is
      all right&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he got no farther than this. For a young lady with demure eyes and
      twitching lips, who was sitting next to him, whispered that Mrs. Judge
      Barrowby was looking, and that he must behave himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have every confidence in Mrs. Judge Barrowby,&rdquo; he, nevertheless,
      managed to assure a grave-looking man across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that Mrs. Judge Barrowby had had her eye on these two young
      people all the voyage. There was no reason that they should not fall in
      love with each other, and marry and be happy ever afterwards; but Mrs
      Judge Barrowby felt that it was incumbent upon them to ask her first, or
      at all events to keep her posted as to the progress of matters, so that
      she might have the satisfaction of knowing more than her neighbours. But
      the young people simply ignored her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Crafer, the mother of the girl with the demure eyes, was a foolish
      woman, who passed most of her days in her cabin; and Mrs. Judge Barrowby
      felt, and went so far as to say to more than one person, that the least
      that a nice-minded girl could, under the circumstances, do was to place
      herself under the protection of some experienced lady&mdash;possibly
      herself. From the fact that Evelyn Crafer had failed to do this, Mrs.
      Judge Barrowby intimated that each might draw an individual inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these thoughts were in course of lithography upon the expressive
      countenance of the lady at the captain's end of the saloon table, strange
      things were taking place on the deck of the good steamship Mooroo. The
      entire crew had, in fact, been summoned on deck. The boats were being
      pushed out&mdash;the davits swung round, the tarpaulin covers removed, and
      the awnings unbent. Life-belts were being collected in the music-room on
      deck, and the purser had given orders to the stewards to prolong dinner as
      much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em have their dinner first,&rdquo; the captain had said significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while the Mooroo was drifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately over the stern rail a light came and went at regular intervals
      on the horizon, while to eastward, at a higher elevation, a great, yellow
      staring eye looked out into the night. This was the light on the
      westernmost point of Europe&mdash;the Pointe de Raz. The smaller beacon,
      low down on the horizon, was that of the Ile de Sein, whose few
      inhabitants live by what the sea brings them in&mdash;be it fish or
      wreckage. There is enough of both. A strong current sets north and east,
      and it becomes almost a &ldquo;race&rdquo; in the narrow channel between the Ile de
      Sein and the rock-bound mainland. The Mooroo was in this current.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain had said no more than the truth. There are times when nature
      is too strong for the strongest man and the keenest brain. There was
      simply nothing to be done but to try and get the repair completed in time&mdash;and
      on deck to send up rockets, and&mdash;to prepare for the worst. This the
      captain had done&mdash;even to unlacing his own boots. The latter is
      always a bad sign. When the captain thinks of his own boots it is time for
      others to try and remember the few good deeds they may have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes the passengers knew; for the captain went and told them&mdash;before
      they had their dessert. The result was confusion, and a rush for the
      saloon stairs. The boats were already lowered and alongside the gangway
      steps in a terrible sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old ladies did wonderfully well, considering their age and other
      things. Mrs. Judge Barrowby was heard to say that she would never travel
      by anything but P. and O. in future, and that it was all her husband's
      fault. But she was third on the stairs, and in time to select the roomiest
      life-belt. Lady Crafer was a great believer in stewards. She clung to one,
      and, calling upon Evelyn to follow her, made very good practice down the
      saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt whatever about young Skeen of the Indian Intelligence.
      He simply took charge of Evelyn Crafer. He took possession of her and told
      her what to do. He even found time to laugh at Mrs. Judge Barrowby's
      ankles as she leapt over a pile of dirty plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here,&rdquo; he cried to Evelyn. &ldquo;It is useless going with that rabble.
      Our only chance is to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed him. Women sometimes do it still. They stood in the gaily
      lighted saloon, and witnessed the rush for the deck&mdash;a humiliating
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length the stairs were clear, Skeen turned and looked into her
      face. Then suddenly he took her in his arms and kissed her. They had been
      drifting towards this for some weeks past. Circumstances had hurried it
      on. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you stay here while I go on deck and see what
      chances there are? If you once get up there in the dark and the confusion,
      I shall lose you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; and as she spoke there was a great crash, which threw
      her into his arms a second time, and made a clean sweep of the tables.
      They stood literally ankle-deep in wine-glasses, dessert, and plates. The
      Mooroo had taken the rocks. There was a rolling crash on the deck
      overhead, and a confused sound of shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay?&rdquo; cried Skeen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and left her there, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On deck he found a crowd. The passengers were being allowed to go to the
      boats. Taking into consideration the darkness, the roaring sea, and the
      hopelessness of it all, the organization was wonderful. The children were
      going first. A quarter-master stood at the head of the gangway steps and
      held the people in check. When Skeen arrived, Mrs. Judge Barrowby was
      giving this man a piece of what she was pleased to call her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; she was saying, &ldquo;let me pass! You do not know who I am. I am the
      wife of Judge Barrowby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marm, you may be the wife of the harkangel Gabriel as far as I knows; but
      I've my orders. Stand aside please. Any more babies in arms?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Judge Barrowby knew the value of a good useful life, and
      persistently blocked up the gangway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One woman is as good as another,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, except the mothers, and they're better,&rdquo; said the man, pushing her
      aside to let a lady and her child pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT woman!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Judge Barrowby. &ldquo;A woman who has been the talk of
      the whole ship&mdash;before ME&mdash;a flirting grass widow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd knows,&rdquo; said the man, holding her back. &ldquo;It's little enough to fight
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will report you, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, marm, to the good God, and I ain't afraid o' HIM! NOW you may go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, fuming, Mrs. Judge Barrowby went down to her death. Not one boat
      could reach the shore through such a surf, as captain and crew well knew;
      but there are certain formalities vis-a-vis to human lives which must be
      observed by ship-captains and doctors and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skeen ran to the other side. Lights were twinkling through the spray; the
      land was not two hundred yards off, but it was two hundred yards of rock
      and surf. There was only one chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skeen kicked off his boots and ran back to the saloon. It was all a matter
      of seconds. For a few moments the brilliant lights dazzled him, and he
      looked round wildly for Evelyn Crafer. A great fear seized his heart as in
      a grip of cold iron&mdash;but only for a moment. He saw her. She was
      kneeling by the table, unaware of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; she was praying aloud, &ldquo;save him&mdash;save HIM from this
      danger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the words as he stopped to lift her like a child from her knees&mdash;bringing
      her back from God to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the end of the Mooroo was a girl sitting before a driftwood fire in
      the cottage of the old cure of the Ile de Sein, while at her feet knelt a
      man with his broken arm bound to his side. And he was stroking her hands
      softly and repeatedly. He was trying to soothe her and make her understand
      that she was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give her time, my son,&rdquo; the old cure said, with his deep, wise smile.
      &ldquo;She only requires time. I have seen them before taken from the sea like
      her. They all require time. It is in our nature to recover from all things&mdash;in
      time.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IN A CARAVAN
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Which means, I think, that go or stay
      Affects you nothing, either way.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is where Parker sleeps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We craned our necks, and, stooping low, saw beneath the vehicle a
      parasitic square box like a huge barnacle fixed to the bottom of the van.
      A box about four feet by two. The door of it was open, and Parker's
      bedfellows&mdash;two iron buckets and a sack of potatoes&mdash;stood
      confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;very nice,&rdquo; we murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's awfully jolly!&rdquo; said the host-in-himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at Parker, who was peeling potatoes on the off-shaft&mdash;Parker,
      six feet two, with a soldier's bearing&mdash;and we drifted off into
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who drives?&rdquo; we asked, with an intelligent interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Parker. And we do all the rest, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was seven o'clock in the evening when we joined the caravan, in a
      stackyard on the outskirts of an Eastern county town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's 'im&mdash;that's Lord George Sanger,&rdquo; was said of the writer by
      one of the crowd of small boys assembled at the stackyard gate. A
      travelling menagerie and circus was advertised in a somewhat &ldquo;voyant&rdquo;
       manner on the town walls, and a fancied resemblance to the aristocratic
      manager thereof accredited us with an honourable connection in the
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you open?&rdquo; inquired an intelligent spectator, anxious to show
      savoir faire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See small handbills,&rdquo; replied the host-in-himself, with equal courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oo are yer, at any rate?&rdquo; inquired an enlightened voter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are YOU?&rdquo; we replied with spirit; and, passing through the gate, we
      closed it to keep out the draught. Then we paid a domiciliary visit, and
      were duly shown Parker's apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In outward appearance the caravan suggested an overgrown bathing-machine.
      The interior resembled the cabin of a yacht. The walls were gaily
      decorated with painting on the panels; flowers bloomed in vases fixed upon
      the wall; two prettily curtained windows&mdash;one a bay, the other flat&mdash;gave
      a view of the surrounding country. At the forward end, against the
      bulkhead, so to speak, was a small but enterprising chest of drawers, and
      above it a large looking-glass which folded down, developed legs, and
      owned to the soft impeachment of being a bed. Beneath the starboard window
      a low and capacious sofa, combining the capacity of a locker. Under the
      port window was fixed a table against the bulkhead, where four people
      could and did dine sumptuously. When en voyage and between meals, charts,
      maps, and literature littered this table pleasantly. A ship's clock hung
      over it, and a corner cupboard did its duty in the port quarter. A heavy
      plush curtain closed off the kitchen and pantry, which were roomy and of
      marvellous capacity. Then the back door&mdash;in halves&mdash;and the back
      step, brassbound, treacherous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front there was a little verandah with supporting columns of bamboo.
      Here we usually sat when travelling&mdash;Parker in the right-hand corner
      handling the ribbons of the tandem cart-horses with skill and discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As dinner was not ready, we proceeded to pitch the small tent wherein the
      two men were to sleep. It was a singular tent, with a vast number of
      pendent ropes which became entangled at the outset. We began with zeal,
      but presently left the ropes and turned our attention to the pegs. These
      required driving in with a wooden mallet and a correct eye. Persons
      unaccustomed to such work strike the peg on one side&mdash;the mallet goes
      off at a tangent and strikes the striker with force upon the shin-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Parker said he would put up the tent &ldquo;by'n-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a Bedlington terrier&mdash;Parker's dog&mdash;attached
      (literally) to the caravan. He was tied to one of the bamboo columns on
      the forecastle, and when Parker absented himself for long he usually
      leaped off the platform and sought death by strangulation&mdash;this we
      discovered later. When we abandoned the tent we thought we would cheer up
      the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch him, sir; he'll bite you,&rdquo; said Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we touched him; no man who respects himself at all is ready to
      admit that a dog bites HIM. It was wonderful how that dog and Parker
      understood each other. But the bite was not serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last dinner was ready, and we are prepared to take any horrid oath
      required that no professional cook could set before a king potatoes more
      mealy. This only, of all the items in the menu, is mentioned, because
      where potatoes are good the experienced know that other things will never
      be amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      We waited on ourselves, and placed the dirty dishes, plates, and forks
      upon the back step, where Parker replaced them in a few minutes, clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the hostess-in-herself, about 10 p.m., when we were
      smoking the beatific pipe, &ldquo;by the way&mdash;Parker's dinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response to united shouts Parker appeared, and learned with apparent
      surprise that he had omitted to dine. He looked pale and worn, and told us
      that he had been blowing out the air-beds. At eleven o'clock we two men
      left the ladies and went out into the cold moonlight, where our tent
      looked remarkably picturesque. Of course we fell over a tent-peg each, and
      the host lost his watchkey. Parker came forward&mdash;dining&mdash;to
      explain where the ropes were, and fell over one himself, losing a piece of
      cold boiled beef in the grass. We hunted for it with a lucifer match. Its
      value was enhanced by the knowledge that when the bed was shut down and
      had developed its legs the larder was inaccessible. After some time Parker
      discovered that the dog had been let loose and had found the beef some
      moments before. He explained that it was a singular dog and preferred to
      live by dishonesty. Unstolen victuals had for him no zest. He added that
      the loss was of no consequence, as he never had been very keen on that
      piece of beef. We finally retired into the tent, and left Parker still at
      work completing several contracts he had undertaken to carry through
      &ldquo;by'n-by.&rdquo; He said he preferred doing them overnight, as it was no good
      getting up BEFORE five on these dark autumnal mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an interior the tent was a decided success. We went inside and hooked
      the flap laboriously from top to bottom. Then we remembered that the
      host's pyjamas were outside. He undid two hooks only and attempted to
      effect a sortie through the resultant interstice. He stuck. The position
      was undignified, and conducive to weak and futile laughter. At last Parker
      had to leave the washing-up of the saucepans to come to the rescue, while
      the dog barked and imagined that he was attending a burglary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly midnight before we made our first acquaintance with an
      air-bed, and it took us until seven o'clock the next morning to get on to
      speaking terms with it. The air-bed, like the Bedlington terrier, must be
      approached with caution. Its manner is, to say the least of it, repellent.
      Unless the sleeper (save the mark!) lies geometrically in the centre, the
      air rushes to one side, and the ignorant roll off the other. If there were
      no bedclothes one could turn round easily, but the least movement throws
      the untucked blanket incontinently into space, while the instability of
      the bed precludes tucking in. Except for these and a few other drawbacks,
      the air-bed may safely be recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning showed a white frost on the grass, and washing in the
      open, in water that had stood all night in a bucket, was, to say the least
      of it, invigorating. Parker browned our boots, put a special edge of his
      own upon our razors, attended to the horses, oiled the wheels, fetched the
      milk, filled the lamps of the paraffin stove, bought a gallon of oil, and
      carried a can of water from a neighbouring farm before breakfast, just by
      way&mdash;he explained&mdash;of getting ready to start his day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      An early start had been projected, but owing to the fact that after
      breakfast Parker had to beat the carpet, wash the dishes, plates, cups and
      saucers, knives and forks, and his own face, strike the tent, let the air
      out of the air-beds, roll up the waterproof sheets, clean the saucepans,
      groom the horses, ship the shafts, send off a parcel from the station, buy
      two loaves of bread, and thank the owner of the stackyard&mdash;owing, I
      say, to the fact that Parker had these things to accomplish while we &ldquo;did
      the rest,&rdquo; it was eleven o'clock before all hands were summoned to get
      &ldquo;her&rdquo; out of the narrow gateway. This was safely accomplished, by Parker,
      while we walked round, looked knowingly at the wheels, sternly at the
      gate-posts, and covertly at the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we clambered up, the host-in-himself cracked the whip, Parker
      gathered up his reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up, Squire! Come up, Nancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the joy of the caravaneer was ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This joy is not like the joy of other men. For the high-road, the
      hedgerows, the birds, the changing sky, the ever-varying landscape, belong
      to the caravaneer. He sits in his moving home and is saturated with the
      freedom of the gipsy without the haunting memory of the police, which sits
      like Care on the roof of the gipsy van. Book on lap, he luxuriates on the
      forecastle when the sun shines and the breeze blows soft, noting idly the
      passing beauty of the scene, returning peaceably to the printed page. When
      rain comes, as it sometimes does in an English summer, he goes inside and
      gives a deeper attention to the book, while Parker drives and gets wet.
      Getting wet is one of Parker's duties. And through rain and sunshine he
      moves on ever, through the peaceful and never dull&mdash;the incomparable
      beauty of an English pastoral land. The journey is accomplished without
      fatigue, without anxiety; for the end of it can only be the quiet corner
      of a moor, or some sleepy meadow. Speed is of no account&mdash;distance
      immaterial. The caravaneer looks down with indifference upon the dense
      curiosity of the smaller towns; the larger cities he wisely avoids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer occupied the humble post of brakesman&mdash;elected thereto in
      all humility by an overpowering majority. The duties are heavy, the glory
      small. A clumsy vehicle like a caravan can hardly venture down the
      slightest incline without a skid under the wheel and a chain round the
      spoke. This necessitates the frequent handling of a heavy piece of iron,
      which is black and greasy at the top of a hill, and red-hot at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A steep hill through the town dispelled the Lord George Sanger illusion at
      one fell blow, the rustic-urban mind being incapable of conceiving that
      that self-named nobleman could demean himself to the laying of the skid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the days that followed there remains the memory of pleasant sunny days
      and cool evenings, of the partridge plucked and cleaned by the roadside,
      fried deliciously over the paraffin flame, amidst fresh butter and
      mushrooms with the dew still on them. We look back with pleasure to the
      quiet camp in a gravel-pit on a hill-top far from the haunts of men&mdash;to
      the pitching of the tent by moonlight in a meadow where the mushrooms
      gleamed like snow, to be duly gathered for the frying-pan next morning by
      the host-in-himself, and in pyjamas. Nor are the sterner sides of caravan
      life to be forgotten&mdash;the calamity at the brow of a steep hill, where
      a nasty turn made the steady old wheeler for once lose his head and his
      legs; the hard-fought battle over a half-side of bacon between the
      Bedlington terrier and the writer when that mistaken dog showed a marked
      preference for the stolen Wiltshire over the partridge bone of charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are pleasant recollections of friends made, and, alas! lost so
      soon; of the merry evening in a country house, of which the hospitable
      host, in his capacity of justice of the peace, gave us short shrift in the
      choice between the county gaol and his hospitality. Unless we consented to
      sleep beneath his roof and eat his salt, he vowed he would commit us for
      vagabonds without visible means of support. We chose the humiliation of a
      good dinner and a sheeted bed. The same open-handed squire hung partridges
      in our larder, and came with us on the forecastle to pilot us through his
      own intricate parish next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also came the last camp and the last dinner, at which the writer
      distinguished himself, and the host-in-himself was at last allowed to
      manipulate (with accompanying lecture) a marvellous bivouac-tin containing
      a compound called beef a la mode, which came provided with its own spirits
      of wine and wick, both of which proved ineffectual to raise the
      temperature of the beef above a mediocre tepidity. Parker, having heard
      that the remains of this toothsome dish were intended for his breakfast,
      wisely hid it with such care that the dog stole it and consumed it, with
      results which cannot be dwelt upon here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the vicissitudes of road travel we recollect but little. The incipient
      sea-sickness endured during the first day has now lost its sting; the
      little differences about the relative virtues of devilled partridge and
      beef a la mode are forgotten, and only the complete novelty, the heedless
      happiness of it all, remains. We did not even know the day of the week or
      the date; which ignorance, my masters, has a wealth of meaning nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Date&mdash;oh, ask Parker!&rdquo; we would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Parker always knew.

      IN THE TRACK OF THE WANDERING JEW
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     What hope is ours&mdash;what hope?  To find no mercy
     After much war, and many travails done?
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, somebody must go; that is certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And more than one man looked at me. It was not because I could possibly be
      that somebody, although I was young enough and of little enough
      consequence. But Fortune had been busy with me. She had knocked all the
      interest out of my life, and then she had proceeded to shower her fickle
      favours upon me. I was by way of becoming a success in that line of life
      wherein I had been cast. I had been mentioned in despatches, and somehow
      the bullets had passed by on the other side. Her gracious Majesty had
      written to me twice as her dearly beloved Thomas, and I was well up in my
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days things were differently done in India. There was less
      telegraphing here and there for instructions. There was more action and
      less talk. The native gentleman did not sit on a jury then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said young Martello, &ldquo;somebody must go. Question is&mdash;who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they looked at me again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be those in high places,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;who shall decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed and made no answer. They were pleased to think that I should
      have to decide which doctor should go to Capoo, where a sickness unknown
      and incomprehensible had broken out. It was true that I was senior surgeon
      of the division; indeed, I was surgeon-major of a tract of country as big
      as Scotland. It is India now, but in the days of which I write the
      question had not been settled with a turbulent native prince. We were, in
      fact, settling that question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capoo was right in the heart of the new country, while we were in
      occupation of a border town. Behind us lay India; in front, the Unknown.
      The garrison of Capoo was small and self-important, but sickness made
      itself conspicuous among its members. Their doctor&mdash;poor young Barber&mdash;died,
      and the self-importance of the Capoo garrison oozed out of their
      finger-ends. They sent down post-haste to us for help, and a special
      letter addressed to me detailed symptoms of no human malady.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had two men under me. The question seemed simple enough. One of them
      would have to go. As to which one there was really no doubt whatever. The
      duty fell upon Thurkow. Thurkow was junior. This might prove to be
      Thurkow's opportunity, or&mdash;the other thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all knew that he would be willing enough to go; nay, he would be eager.
      But Thurkow's father was in command, which made all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were thinking over these things an orderly appeared at the
      mess-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brigadier would like to see you, sir,&rdquo; he said to me. And I had to throw
      away the better half of a first-class manilla.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier's quarters were across a square in the centre of a long
      rambling palace, for which a handsome rent was duly paid. We were not
      making war. On the contrary, we were forcing peace down the throat of the
      native prince on the point of a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was upon a friendly footing. We were not an invading force. Oh,
      no! we were only the escort of a political officer. We had been quartered
      in this border town for more than a year, and the senior officers'
      lady-wives had brought their lares and penates in three bullock-carts
      a-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose we were objects of envy. We had all the excitement of novelty
      without any of the penalties of active warfare. We were strong enough to
      make an awful example of the whole Principality at a day's notice, and the
      Principality knew it, which kept bazaar prices down and made the coloured
      brother remember the hue of his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the palace there were half a dozen officers' quarters, and these had
      been apportioned to the married; consequently the palace had that air of
      homeliness which is supposed to be lacking in the quarters of single men.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was crossing the square I heard some one running after me, and,
      turning, I faced Fitz. Fitz Marner&mdash;usually called Fitz&mdash;was my
      second in command and two years my junior. He was quite a different sort
      of man to myself, and, if I may say so, a much better man. However, I am
      not going to talk about myself more than I can help this time. Some day I
      shall, and then I shall have a portrait on the cover. This is an age of
      portraits. But some day the British public will wake up and will refuse to
      read the works of a smug-faced man in spectacles who tries to make them
      believe that he is doughty, fearless, and beloved of beautiful damsels.
      The bookstalls are full to-day of works written in the first person
      singular, and relating deeds of the utmost daring; while on the cover is a
      portrait of the author&mdash;the aforesaid smug man in spectacles&mdash;who
      has not the good sense to suppress himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitz was tall and lithe. He had a large brown moustache and pleasantly
      thoughtful eyes. His smile was the kindliest I have ever met. Moreover, a
      modester man than Fitz never breathed. He had a way of carrying his chin
      rather low, so that when he looked at one he had to raise his eyes, which
      imparted a pleasing suggestion of attention to his face. It always seemed
      to me that Fitz listened more carefully to what was said to him than other
      men are in the habit of doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, doctor,&rdquo; he said, looking up at me in his peculiar thoughtful way,
      &ldquo;give me a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew what he meant. He wanted me to send him to a certain death instead
      of young Thurkow. Those little missions to that bourne from whence no
      traveller returns are all in the work of a soldier's life, and we two were
      soldiers, although ours was the task of repairing instead of doing the
      damage. Every soldier-man and most civilians know that it is sometimes the
      duty of a red-coat to go and get killed without pausing to ask whether it
      be expedient or not. One aide-de-camp may be sent on a mad attempt to get
      through the enemy's lines, while his colleague rides quietly to the rear
      with a despatch inside his tunic, the delivery of which to the
      commander-in-chief will ensure promotion. And in view of this the
      wholesome law of seniority was invented. The missions come in rotation,
      and according to seniority the men step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitz Marner's place was at my side, where, by the way, I never want a
      better man, for his will was iron, and he had no nerves whatever. Capoo,
      the stricken, was calling for help. Fitz and I knew more about cholera
      than we cared to discuss just then. Some one must go up to Capoo to fight
      a hopeless fight and die. And old Fitz&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;was
      asking to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I can help it. The fortune of war is the same for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fitz tugged at his moustache and looked gravely at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard on the old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is more than you can expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I gave up expecting justice some years ago. I am
      sorry for the brigadier, of course. He committed the terrible mistake of
      getting his son into his own brigade, and this is the result. All that he
      does to-night he does on his own responsibility. I am not inclined to help
      him. If it had been you, I should not have moved an inch&mdash;you know
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned half away, looking up speculatively at the yellow Indian moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without another word he went back to the mess-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on and entered the palace. To reach the brigadier's quarters I had
      to pass down the whole length of the building, and I was not in the least
      surprised to see Elsie Matheson waiting for me in one of the passage-like
      ante-rooms. Elsie Matheson was bound to come into this matter sooner or
      later&mdash;I knew that; but I did not quite know in what capacity her
      advent might be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this news from Capoo?&rdquo; she asked, without attempting to disguise
      her anxiety. Her father, assistant political officer in this affair, was
      not at Capoo or near there. He was upstairs playing a rubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She winced, but turned no paler. Women and horses are always surprising
      me, and they never surprise me more than when in danger. Elsie Matheson
      was by no means a masculine young person. Had she been so, I should not
      have troubled to mention her. For me, men cannot be too manly, nor women
      too womanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the illness they have?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot tell you, Elsie,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Old Simpson has written me
      a long letter&mdash;he always had a fancy for symptoms, you know&mdash;but
      I can make nothing of it. The symptoms he describes are quite impossible.
      They are too scientific for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it is cholera,&rdquo; she snapped out with a strange little break in
      her voice which I did not like, for I was very fond of this girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a funny little helpless look round her as if she wanted something
      to lean against.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who will go?&rdquo; she asked. She was watching me keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;that does not rest with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face lighted up suddenly. She had not thought of that. I bore her no
      ill-feeling, however. I did not expect her to love ME.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they cannot spare you,&rdquo; she was kind enough to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody can always be spared&mdash;with alacrity,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but it
      is not a question of that. It is a question of routine. One of the others
      will have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; she asked with a suddenly assumed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was precisely the question in my own mind, but relative to a very
      different matter. If the decision rested with Miss Matheson, which of
      these two men would she send to Capoo? Perhaps I looked rather too keenly
      into her face, for she turned suddenly away and drew the gauzy wrap she
      had thrown over her evening dress more closely round her throat, for the
      passages were cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not rest with me,&rdquo; I repeated, and I went on towards the
      brigadier's quarters, leaving her&mdash;a white shadow in the dimly
      lighted passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the chief at his own dinner-table with an untouched glass of wine
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bad business,&rdquo; he said, looking at me with haggard eyes. I had
      never quite realized before what an old man he was. His trim beard and
      moustache had been white for years, but he had always been a hale man up
      to his work&mdash;a fine soldier but not a great leader. There was a vein
      of indolence in Brigadier-General Thurkow's nature which had the same
      effect on his career as that caused by barnacles round a ship's keel. This
      inherent indolence was a steady drag on the man's life. Only one interest
      thoroughly aroused him&mdash;only one train of thought received the full
      gift of his mind. This one absorbing interest was his son Charlie, and it
      says much for Charlie Thurkow that we did not hate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier had lost his wife years before. All that belonged to ancient
      history&mdash;to the old Company days before our time. To say that he was
      absorbed in his son is to state the case in the mildest imaginable form.
      The love in this old man's heart for his reckless, happy-souled offspring
      was of that higher order which stops at nothing. There is a love that
      worketh wonders, and the same love can make a villain of an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at old Thurkow, sitting white-lipped behind the decanter, and I
      knew that there was villainy in his upright, honest heart. He scarcely met
      my eyes. He moved uneasily in his chair. All through a long life this man
      had carried nobly the noblest name that can be given to any&mdash;the name
      of gentleman. No great soldier, but a man of dauntless courage. No
      strategist, but a leader who could be trusted with his country's honour.
      Upright, honourable, honest, brave&mdash;and it had come to this. It had
      come to his sitting shamefaced before a poor unknown sawbones&mdash;not
      daring to look him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His duty was plain enough. Charlie Thurkow's turn had come. Charlie
      Thurkow must be sent to Capoo&mdash;by his father's orders. But the old
      man&mdash;the soldier who had never turned his back on danger&mdash;could
      not do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were old friends, this man and I. I owed him much. He had made my
      career, and I am afraid I had been his accomplice more than once. But we
      had never wronged any other man. Fitz had aided and abetted more than
      once. It had been an understood thing between Fitz and myself that the
      winds of our service were to be tempered to Charlie Thurkow, and I imagine
      we had succeeded in withholding the fact from his knowledge. Like most
      spoilt sons, Charlie was a little selfish, with that convenient blindness
      which does not perceive how much dirty work is done by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we had never deceived the brigadier. He was not easily deceived in
      those matters which concerned his son. I knew the old man very well, and
      for years I had been content to sit by the hour together and talk with him
      of Charlie. To tell the honest truth, Master Charlie was a very ordinary
      young man. I take it that a solution of all that was best in five Charles
      Thurkows would make up one Fitz Marner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something horribly pathetic in the blindness of this usually
      keen old man on this one point. He would sit there stiffly behind the
      decanter fingering his wine-glass, and make statements about Charlie which
      would have made me blush had that accomplishment not belonged to my past.
      A certain cheery impertinence which characterized Charlie was fondly set
      down as savoir-faire and dash. A cheap wit was held to be brilliancy and
      conversational finish. And somehow we had all fallen into the way of
      humouring the brigadier. I never told him, for instance, that his son was
      a very second-rate doctor and a nervous operator. I never hinted that many
      of the cures which had been placed to his credit were the work of Fitz&mdash;that
      the men had no confidence in Charlie, and that they were somewhat
      justified in their opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a bad business,&rdquo; repeated the brigadier, looking hard at the
      despatch that lay on the table before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed the paper towards me and pointed to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;Have you had any report from poor Barber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response I handed him the beginning of an official report. I say the
      beginning, because it consisted of four lines only. It was in Barber's
      handwriting, and it broke off suddenly in the middle of a word before it
      began to tell me anything. In its way it was a tragedy. Death had called
      for Barber while he was wondering how to spell &ldquo;nauseous.&rdquo; I also gave him
      Colonel Simpson's letter, which he read carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, as he laid the papers aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officially&mdash;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And unofficially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is cholera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier raised his glass of claret a few inches from the table, but
      his hand was too unsteady, and he set the glass down again untouched. I
      was helplessly sorry for him. There was something abject and humiliating
      in his averted gaze. Beneath his white moustache his lips were twitching
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments there was silence, and I dreaded his next words. I was
      trembling for his manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose something must be done for them,&rdquo; he said at length, hoarsely,
      and it was hard to believe that the voice was the voice of our leader&mdash;a
      man dreaded in warfare, respected in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered uncompromisingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one must go to them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there was that horrid silence, broken only by the tramp of the
      sentinel outside the glassless windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked the brigadier, in little more than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he expected it of me&mdash;I suppose he knew that even for him,
      even in mercy to an old man whose only joy in life trembled at that moment
      in the balance, I could not perpetrate a cruel injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It devolves on Charlie,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave one quick glance beneath his lashes, and again lowered his eyes. I
      heard a long gasping sound, as if he found difficulty in breathing. He sat
      upright, and threw back his shoulders with a pitiable effort to be strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he up to the work?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot conscientiously say that he is not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it, man,&rdquo; he burst out suddenly, &ldquo;is there no way out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;one way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; he answered with a sublime unconsciousness of his
      own huge selfishness which almost made me laugh. This man would have asked
      nothing for himself. For his son he had no shame in asking all. He would
      have accepted my offer, I could see that, had it been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the door opened, and Charlie Thurkow came in. His eyes were
      bright with excitement, and he glanced at us both quickly. He was quite
      well aware of his father's weakness in regard to himself, and I am afraid
      he sometimes took advantage of it. He often ignored discipline entirely,
      as he did in coming into the room at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose there is in every one a sense of justice which accounts for the
      subtle annoyance caused by the devotion of parents and others&mdash;a
      devotion which has not the good sense to hide itself. There are few things
      more annoying than an exhibition of unjust love. I rose at once. The
      coming interview would be either painful or humiliating, and I preferred
      not to assist at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went down the dark passages a man in a staff uniform, wearing spurs,
      clanked past me. I did not know until later that it was Fitz, for I could
      not see his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my quarters, and was busy for some time with certain
      technicalities of my trade which are not worth detailing here. While I and
      my two dispensers were still measuring out and mixing drugs, Fitz came to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Capoo,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his silent, quick way he was taking in all that we were doing. We were
      packing medical stores for Capoo. I did not answer him, but waited for
      further details. We could not speak openly before the two assistants at
      that moment, and somehow we never spoke about it at all. I glanced up at
      him. His face was pale beneath the sunburn. There was a drawn look just
      above his moustache, as if his lips were held tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I volunteered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the brigadier accepted my offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever the word &ldquo;duty&rdquo; is mentioned, I think of Fitz to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing, but went on with my work. The whole business was too
      disgusting, too selfish, too unjust, to bear speaking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had long known that Fitz loved Elsie Matheson. In my feeble way,
      according to my scanty opportunity, I had endeavoured to assist him. But
      her name had never been mentioned between us except carelessly in passing
      conversation. I knew no details. I did not even know whether Elsie knew of
      his love; but it was exceedingly likely that if she did, he had not told
      her. As to her feelings, I was ignorant. She loved somebody, that much I
      knew. One can generally tell that. One sees it in a woman's eyes. But it
      is one thing to know that a woman loves, and quite another to find out
      whom she loves. I have tried in vain more than once. I once thought that I
      was the favoured person&mdash;not with Elsie, with quite another woman&mdash;but
      I was mistaken. I only know that those women who have that in their eyes
      which I have learnt to recognize are better women than those who lack it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitz was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't put all of that into one case,&rdquo; he said to one of the dispensers,
      indicating a row of bottles that stood on the floor. &ldquo;Divide the different
      drugs over the cases, so that one or two of them can be lost without doing
      much harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was quite calm and practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo; I asked curtly. I was rather afraid of trusting my voice
      too long, for Fitz was one of the few men who have really entered into my
      life sufficiently to leave a blank space behind them. I have been a
      rolling stone, and what little moss I ever gathered soon got knocked off,
      but it left scars. Fitz left a scar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My orders are to start to-night&mdash;with one trooper,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ride with you a few miles,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and went to his quarters, which were next to mine. I was still
      at work when Charlie Thurkow came in. He had changed his dress clothes for
      an old working suit. I was working in my evening dress&mdash;a subtle
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want any help?&rdquo; he asked. I could hear a grievance in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; get on packing that case; plenty of straw between the
      bottles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed me, working slowly, badly, without concentration, as he always
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a beastly shame, isn't it?&rdquo; he muttered presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose he did not detect the sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes me look a fool,&rdquo; he said heatedly. &ldquo;Why couldn't the governor let
      me go and take my chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this question being beyond my ken, I kept a discreet
      silence. Giving him further instructions, I presently left my junior to
      complete the task of packing up the necessary medicaments for Capoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than half an hour Fitz and I mounted our horses. A few of the
      fellows came out of the messroom, cigar in mouth, to say good-bye to Fitz.
      One or two of them called out &ldquo;Good luck&rdquo; as we left them. Each wish was
      followed by a little laugh, as if the wisher was ashamed of showing even
      so minute an emotion. It was, after all, all in the way of our business.
      Many a time Fitz and I had stood idle while these same men rode out to
      face death. It was Fitz's turn now&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sikh trooper was waiting for us in the middle of the square&mdash;in
      the moonlight&mdash;a grand picturesque figure. A long-faced, silent man,
      with deep eyes and a grizzled moustache. He wheeled his horse, and dropped
      ten paces in our rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a varied experience Fitz and I had learnt to ride hard.
      We rode hard that night beneath the yellow moon, through the sleeping,
      odorous country. We both knew too well that cholera under canvas is like a
      fire in a timber-yard. You may pump your drugs upon it, but without avail
      unless the pumping be scientific. Fitz represented science. Every moment
      meant a man's life. Our horses soon settled into their stride with a
      pleasant creaking sound of warm leather and willing lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was above and behind us; we each had a galloping shadow beneath
      our horse's forefeet. It was a sandy country, and the hoofs only produced
      a dull thud. There was something exhilarating in the speed&mdash;in the
      shimmering Indian atmosphere. A sense of envy came over me, and I dreaded
      the moment when I should have to turn and ride soberly home, leaving Fitz
      to complete his forty-five miles before daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were riding our chargers. They had naturally fallen into step, and
      bounded beneath us with a regular, mechanical rhythm. Both alike had their
      heads down, their shoulders forward, with that intelligent desire to do
      well which draws a man's heart towards a horse in preference to any other
      animal. I looked sideways at Fitz, and waited for him to speak. But he was
      staring straight in front of him, and seemed lost in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; I said at length, &ldquo;you have done that old man an ill-turn.
      Even if you come back he will never forgive himself. He will never look
      either of us straight in the face again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help that,&rdquo; replied Fitz. &ldquo;The thing&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, as if
      choosing his words. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he went on rather quickly, &ldquo;the worst comes to
      the worst, don't let people&mdash;ANY ONE&mdash;think that I did it
      because I didn't care, because I set no value on my life. The thing was
      forced upon me. I was asked to volunteer for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I answered, rather absent-mindedly perhaps. I was wondering
      who &ldquo;any one&rdquo; might be, and also who had asked him to throw away his life.
      The latter might, of course, be the brigadier. Surely it could not have
      been Elsie. But, as I said before, I always was uncertain about women.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not say anything about hoping for the best. Fitz and I had left all
      that nonsense behind us years before. We did our business amidst battle,
      murder, and sudden death. Perhaps we were callous, perhaps we had only
      learnt to value the thing at its true worth, and did not set much fear on
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, I must ask you to believe, we fell to talking &ldquo;shop.&rdquo; I knew a
      little more about cholera than did Fitz, and we got quite interested in
      our conversation. It is, I have found, only in books that men use the last
      moment to advantage. Death has been my road-fellow all through life, and
      no man has yet died in my arms saying quite the right thing. Some of them
      made a joke, others were merely commonplace, as all men really are whether
      living or dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for me to turn back, Fitz had said nothing fit for
      post-mortem reproduction. We had talked unmitigated &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; except the few
      odd observations I have set down.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shook hands, and I turned back at once. As I galloped I looked back,
      and in the light of the great tropical moon I saw Fitz sitting forward in
      his saddle as the horse rose to the slope of a hill, galloping away into
      the night, into the unknown, on his mission of mercy. At his heels rode
      the Sikh, enormous, silent, soldierly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my steady run home I thought of those things concerning my craft
      which required immediate consideration. Would it be necessary to send down
      to India for help? Cholera at Capoo might mean cholera everywhere in this
      new unknown country. What about the women and children? The Wandering Jew
      was abroad; would he wander in our direction, with the legendary curse
      following on his heels? Was I destined to meet this dread foe a third
      time? I admit that the very thought caused a lump to rise in my throat.
      For I love Thomas Atkins. He is manly and honest according to his lights.
      It does not hurt me very much to see him with a bullet through his lungs
      or a sabre cut through the collar-bone down to the same part of his
      anatomy. But it does hurt me exceedingly to see honest Thomas die between
      the sheets&mdash;the death of any common civilian beggar. Thomas is too
      good for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly three o'clock in the morning when I rode into the palace
      square. All round I saw the sentinels, their bayonets gleaming in the
      moonlight. A man was walking backwards and forwards in the middle of the
      square by himself. When he heard me he came towards me. At first I thought
      that it was my servant waiting to take the horse, but a moment later I
      recognized Charlie Thurkow&mdash;recognized him by his fair hair, for he
      was hatless. At the same time my syce roused himself from slumber in the
      shadow of an arch, and ran forward to my stirrup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the hospital!&rdquo; said Thurkow, the moment I alighted. His voice was
      dull and unnatural. I once heard a man speak in the same voice while
      collecting his men for a rush which meant certain death. The man was duly
      killed, and I think he was trembling with fear when he ran to his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked&mdash;almost ran&mdash;to the hospital, a long low building in
      the palace compound. Charlie Thurkow led the way to a ward which we had
      never used&mdash;a ward I had set apart for infectious cases. A man was
      dozing in a long chair in the open window. As we entered he rose hastily
      and brought a lamp. We bent over a bed&mdash;the only one occupied. The
      occupant was a man I did not know. He looked like a Goorkha, and he was
      dying. In a few moments I knew all that there was to know. I knew that the
      Wandering Jew had passed our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, rising from my knees at the bedside; &ldquo;we have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the days that followed it is not my intention to say much. A woman once
      told me that I was afraid of nothing. She was mistaken. If she chance to
      read this and recognize it, I hope she will believe the assertion: I am,
      and always have been, afraid of cholera&mdash;in India. In Europe it is a
      different matter. The writing of those days would be unpleasant to me; the
      reading would be still less pleasant to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brigadier-General Thurkow rose to the occasion, as we all expected him to
      do. It is one thing to send a man to a distant danger, and quite another
      to go with him into a danger which is close at hand. Charlie Thurkow and I
      were the only two doctors on the spot, and before help could reach us we
      should probably all be dead or cured. There was no shirking now. Charlie
      and I were at work night and day, and in the course of thirty-six hours
      Charlie got interested in it. He reached the fighting point&mdash;that
      crisis in an epidemic of which doctors can tell&mdash;that point where
      there is a certain glowing sense of battle over each bed&mdash;where death
      and the doctor see each other face to face&mdash;fight hand to hand for
      the life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor loses his interest in the patient as a friend or a patient; all
      his attention is centred on the life as a life, and a point to be scored
      against the adversary Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had a very bad time for two days. At the end of that time I had
      officers bearing Her Majesty's commission serving under me as assistant
      nurses, and then the women came into it. The first to offer herself was
      the wife of a non-commissioned officer in the Engineers, who had been
      through Netley. I accepted her. The second woman was Elsie Matheson. I
      refused point blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sooner or later,&rdquo; she said, looking at me steadily with something in her
      eyes which I could not make out, &ldquo;you will have to take me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your father know you have come to me?&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I came with his consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shook my head and returned to my writing. I was filling in a list of
      terrific length. She did not go away, but stood in front of me with a
      certain tranquillity which was unnatural under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want help?&rdquo; she asked calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not mine&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Elsie. I have not got so far as that yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not look up, and she stood quite still over me&mdash;looking down at
      me&mdash;probably noting that the hair was getting a little thin on the
      top of my head. This is not a joke. I repeat she was probably noting that.
      People do note such things at such moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not take me,&rdquo; she said, in a singularly even voice, &ldquo;I shall go
      up to Capoo. Can you not see that that is the only thing that can save me
      from going to Capoo&mdash;or going mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laid aside my pen, and looked up into her face, which she made no
      pretence of hiding from me. And I saw that it was as she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go to work at once,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;under Mrs. Martin, in ward number
      four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had left me I did not go on filling in the list from the notes in
      my pocket-book. I fell to wasting time instead. So it was Fitz. I was not
      surprised, but I was very pleased. I was not surprised, because I have
      usually found that the better sort of woman has as keen a scent for the
      good men as we have. And I thought of old Fitz&mdash;the best man I ever
      served with&mdash;fighting up at Capoo all alone, while I fought down in
      the valley. There was a certain sense of companionship in the thought,
      though my knowledge and experience told me that our chances of meeting
      again were very small indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had not heard from Capoo. The conclusion was obvious: they had no one
      to send.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie Matheson soon became a splendid nurse. She was quite fearless&mdash;not
      with dash, but with the steady fearlessness that comes from an
      ever-present sense of duty, which is the best. She was kind and tender,
      but she was a little absent. In spirit she was nursing at Capoo; with us
      she was only in the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charlie Thurkow heard that she had gone into ward number four, he
      displayed a sudden, singular anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not fit for her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How could you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I noticed that, so far as lay in his power, he kept the worst cases
      away from number four.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occasionally happens in life that duty is synonymous with inclination;
      not often, of course, but occasionally. I twisted inclination round into
      duty, and put Elsie to night work, while Charlie Thurkow kept the day
      watches. I myself was forced to keep both as best I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I went into number four ward at night before (save the mark)
      going to bed, I found Elsie Matheson waiting for me. It must be remembered
      that she was quite cut off from the little world that surrounded us in the
      palace. She had no means of obtaining news. Her only link with the outer
      universe was an occasional patient brought in more dead than alive, and
      too much occupied with his own affairs to trouble about those of other
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; she would whisper to me as we went round the beds together;
      and I knew that she meant Capoo. Capoo was all the world for her. It is
      strange how some little unknown spot on the earth will rise up and come
      into our lives never to leave the memory again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I replied with a melancholy regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once only she broke through her reserve&mdash;through the habit of bearing
      pain in silence which she had acquired by being so much among dying men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no opinion?&rdquo; she asked, with a sharpness in her voice which I
      forgave as I heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon what subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon... the chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a good man&mdash;there is no better in India&mdash;that is all I
      can say. Just hold the candle a little closer, will you, please? Thanks&mdash;yes&mdash;he
      is quite dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We passed on to the next bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is both his duty and his inclination to take care of himself,&rdquo; I said
      as we went&mdash;going back with her in the spirit to Capoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it is his inclination?&rdquo; she asked guardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I knew that I was on the right path. The vague message given to &ldquo;any
      one&rdquo; by Fitz as he rode by my side that night&mdash;only a week before,
      although it seemed to be months&mdash;that message was intended for Elsie.
      It referred to something that had gone before, of which I had no
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he told me so,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then we went on with our work. Charlie Thurkow was quite right. I knew
      that all along. It was not fit for her. Elsie was too young, too gentle
      and delicate for such a place as ward number four. I make no mention of
      her beauty, for I took no heed of it then. It was there&mdash;but it had
      nothing to do with this matter. Also I have never seen why women who are
      blessed or cursed by beauty should be more considered in such matters, as
      they undoubtedly are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was up and about all that night. The next morning rose gloomily, as if
      the day was awakening unrefreshed by a feverish sleep. The heat had been
      intense all night, and we could look for nothing but an intensification of
      it when the sun rose with a tropical aggressiveness. I wanted to get my
      reports filled in before lying down to snatch a little rest, and was still
      at work when Charlie Thurkow came in to relieve me. He looked ghastly, but
      we all did that, and I took no notice. He took up the ward-sheets and
      glanced down the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I had gone to Capoo,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It couldn't have been worse than
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had finished my writing, and I rose. As I did so Charlie suddenly
      clapped his hand to his hip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me in a stupid way, and then suddenly he tottered towards me,
      and I caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old chap!&rdquo; he exclaimed thickly, with his face against my shoulder, &ldquo;I've
      got it. Take me to number four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had seen by the list that there was a vacant cot in number four.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carried him there, stumbling as I went, for I was weak from want of
      sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie had just gone to her room, and Mrs. Martin was getting the vacant
      bed ready. I was by that bedside all day. All that I knew I did for
      Charlie Thurkow. I dosed myself with more than one Indian drug to
      stimulate the brain&mdash;to keep myself up to doing and thinking. This
      was a white man's life, and God forgive me if I set undue store upon it as
      compared with the black lives we were losing daily. This was a brain that
      could think for the rest. There was more than one man's life wrapped up in
      Charlie Thurkow's. One can never tell. My time might come at any moment,
      and the help we had sent for could not reach us for another fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie said nothing. He thanked me at intervals for some little service
      rendered, and nearly all the time his eyes were fixed upon the clock. He
      was reckoning with his own life. He did not want to die in the day, but in
      the night. He was deliberately spinning out his life till the night nurse
      came on duty. I suppose that in his superficial, happy-go-lucky way he
      loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled him through that day, and we managed to refrain from waking Elsie
      up. At nightfall she came to her post. When she came into the room I was
      writing a note to the brigadier. I watched her face as she came towards
      us. There was only distress upon it&mdash;nothing else. Even women&mdash;even
      beautiful women grow callous; thank Heaven! Charlie Thurkow gave a long
      sigh of relief when she came.
    </p>
    <p>
      My note was duly sent to the brigadier, and five minutes afterwards I went
      out on to the verandah to speak to him. I managed to keep him out of the
      room by a promise that he should be sent for later. I made no pretence
      about it, and he knew that it was only the question of a few hours when he
      walked back across the palace square to his quarters. I came back to the
      verandah, and found Elsie waiting to speak to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a strange glitter in her eyes which I could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; I answered, forgetting to be professional. She looked at me for a
      moment as if she were about to say something, and then she apparently
      decided not to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went towards a long chair which stood on the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lie down here,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and sleep for an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; she answered almost gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will wake me if you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake me when... the change comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments I was asleep. I do not know what woke me up. It seemed to
      be very late. All the sounds of barrack life were hushed. The moon was
      just up. I rose to my feet and turned to the open window. But there I
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie was kneeling by Charlie Thurkow's bed. She was leaning over him, and
      I could see that she was kissing him. And I knew that she did not love
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kicked against the chair purposely. Elsie turned and looked towards me,
      with her hand still resting on Charlie Thurkow's forehead. She beckoned me
      to go to them, and I saw at once that he was much weaker. She was stroking
      his hair gently. She either gave me credit for great discernment, or she
      did not care what I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that the time had come for me to fulfil my promise to the brigadier,
      and went out of the open window to send one of the sentinels for him. As I
      was speaking to the man I heard the clatter of a horse's feet, and a Sikh
      rode hard into the palace square. I went towards him, and he, recognizing
      me, handed me a note which he extracted from the folds of his turban. I
      opened the paper and read it by the light of the moon. My heart gave a
      leap in my throat. It was from Fitz. News at last from Capoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got it under,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;I am coming down to help you. Shall be
      with you almost as soon as the bearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I walked back towards the hospital the brigadier came running behind
      me, and caught me up as I stepped in by the window. I had neither time nor
      inclination just then to tell him that I had news from Capoo. The Sikh no
      doubt brought official news which would reach their destination in due
      course. And in the mean time Charlie Thurkow was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood round that bed and waited silent, emotionless for the angel.
      Charlie knew only too well that the end was very near. From time to time
      he smiled rather wearily at one or the other of us, and once over his face
      there came that strange look of a higher knowledge which I have often
      noted, as if he knew something that we did not&mdash;something which he
      had been forbidden to tell us.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were standing there the matting of the window was pushed aside,
      and Fitz came softly into the dimly lighted room. He glanced at me, but
      attempted no sort of salutation. I saw him exchange a long silent look
      with Elsie, and then he took his station at the bedside next to Elsie, and
      opposite to the brigadier, who never looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie Thurkow recognized him, and gave him one of those strangely
      patronizing smiles. Then he turned his sunken eyes towards Elsie. He
      looked at her with a gaze that became more and more fixed. We stood there
      for a few minutes&mdash;then I spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brigadier raised his eyes and looked across to Fitz. For a second
      these two men looked down into each other's souls, and I suppose Fitz had
      his reward. I suppose the brigadier had paid his debt in full. I had been
      through too many painful scenes to wish to prolong this. So I turned away,
      and a general move was the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I saw that Elsie and Fitz had been standing hand-in-hand all the
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      So wags the world.

      THROUGH THE GATE OF TEARS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Give us&mdash;ah! give us&mdash;but Yesterday!
</pre>
    <p>
      In the old days, when the Mahanaddy was making her reputation, she had her
      tragedy. And Dr. Mark Ruthine has not forgotten it, nor forgiven himself
      yet. Doctors, like the rest of us, are apt to make a hideous mistake or
      two which resemble the stream anchors of a big steamer warping out into
      the Hooghly. We leave them behind, but we do not let go of them. They make
      a distinct difference to the course of our journey down the stream.
      Sometimes they hold us back; occasionally they swing us into the middle of
      the current, where there is no shoal. Like the stream anchors, they are
      always there, behind us, for our good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few of the Mahanaddy passengers have remarked that Mark Ruthine
      invariably locks his cabin-door whenever he leaves the little den that
      serves him for surgery and home. This is the outward sign of an inward
      unforgotten sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, by the way, is not a moral tale. Virtue does not triumph, nor will
      vice be crushed. It is the mere record of a few mistakes, culminating in
      Mark Ruthine's blunder&mdash;a little note on human nature without vice in
      it; for there is little vice in human nature if one takes the trouble to
      sift that which masquerades as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, in old days, long ago, on an outward voyage to Madras,
      that Miss Norah Hood was placed under the care of the captain, hedged
      safely round by an engagement to an old playmate, and shipped off to the
      land where the Anglo-Saxon dabbles in tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norah is fortunately not a common name. Mark Ruthine's countenance&mdash;a
      still one&mdash;changes ever so slightly whenever he hears the name or
      sees it in print. Another outward sign, and, as such, naturally small.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the captain was introduced by a tall and refined old clergyman to
      Miss Norah Hood, he found himself shaking hands with a grave young person
      of unassertive beauty. Hers was the loveliness of the violet, which is apt
      to pall in this modern day&mdash;to aggravate, and to suggest wanton
      waste. For feminine loveliness is on the wane&mdash;marred, like many
      other good things, by over-education. Norah Hood was a typical country
      parson's daughter, who knew the right and did it, ignored the wrong and
      refused to believe in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was busy with his Mahanaddy. He looked over his shoulder, and,
      seeing Mark Ruthine, called him by a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my doctor,&rdquo; he said, to the scholarly parson. &ldquo;He will be happy
      to see that Miss Hood is comfortably settled among us. I am naturally
      rather a busy man until we leave the Start Light behind us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mark Ruthine hovered about, and discreetly looked the other way when
      the moment of parting came. He suspected, shrewdly enough, that Norah was
      the eldest of a large family&mdash;one less to feed and clothe. An old
      story. As the great ship glided gently away from the quay&mdash;in those
      days the Mahanaddy loaded at Southampton&mdash;he went and stood beside
      Norah Hood. Not that he had anything to say to her; but his calling of
      novelist, his experience of doctor, taught him that a silent support is
      what women sometimes want. They deal so largely in words that a few
      unexplained deeds sometimes refresh them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there until the tall, slim form in the rusty black coat was no
      longer discernible. Then he made a little movement and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been to your cabin?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen it,&rdquo; she answered composedly. &ldquo;The number of my berth is
      seventy-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a singular lack of fluster. It was impossible to divine that she
      had never trod the deck of a big steamer before&mdash;that her walk in
      life had been limited to the confines of a tiny, remote parish in the
      eastern counties. Ruthine glanced at her. He saw that she was quite
      self-possessed, with something more complete than the self-possession of
      good breeding. It was quite obvious that this woman&mdash;for Norah Hood
      was leaving girlhood behind&mdash;had led a narrow, busy life. She had
      obviously lost the habit of attaching much importance to her own feelings,
      her own immediate fate or passing desires, because more pressing matters
      had so long absorbed her. There was a faint suggestion of that
      self-neglect, almost amounting to self-contempt, which characterizes the
      manner of overburdened motherhood. This would account for her apparent
      ignorance of the fact that she was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he led the way down below Ruthine glanced at her again. He had an easy
      excuse for so doing on the brass-bound stairs, where landsmen feet may
      slip. He was, above all things, a novelist, although he wrote under
      another and greater name, and those around him knew him not. He looked
      more at human minds than human bodies, and he was never weary of telling
      his friends that he was a poor doctor. He concluded&mdash;indeed, her
      father had almost told him&mdash;that she was going out to be married. But
      he needed not to be told that she was going to marry a man whom she did
      not love. He found that out for himself in a flash of his quiet grey eyes.
      An expert less skilful than himself could see that Norah Hood did not know
      what love was. Some women are thus&mdash;some few, God help them! go
      through life in the same ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her down to her cabin&mdash;a small one, which she was fortunate
      enough to have to herself. He told her the hours of the meals, the habits
      of the ship, and the customs of the ocean. He had a grave way with him,
      this doctor, and could put on a fatherly manner when the moment needed it.
      Norah listened with a gravity equal to his own. She listened, moreover,
      with an intelligence which he noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on deck again, I will introduce you to a
      very kind friend of mine&mdash;Mrs. Stellasis. You have heard of John
      Stellasis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Norah, rather indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will some day&mdash;all the world will. Stellasis is one of our great
      men in India. Mrs. Stellasis is a great lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on deck, and Mark Ruthine effected the introduction. He stayed
      beside them for a few moments, and did not leave them until they were
      deeply engrossed in a conversation respecting babies in general, and in
      particular a small specimen which Mrs. Stellasis had lately received.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Indian-going steamer is rather like a big box of toys. She goes bumping
      down Channel, rolling through the Bay, and, by the time that Gibraltar is
      left behind, she has shaken her passengers into their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norah Hood shook down very quietly into the neighbourhood of Mrs.
      Stellasis, who liked her and began to understand her. Mrs. Stellasis&mdash;a
      good woman and a mother&mdash;pitied Norah Hood with an increasing pity;
      for as the quiet Mediterranean days wore to a close she had established
      without doubt the fact that the engagement to the old playmate was a
      sordid contract entered into in all innocence by a girl worthy of a better
      fate. But Mrs. Stellasis hoped for the best. She thought of the &ldquo;specimen&rdquo;
       slumbering in a berth six sizes too large for it, and reflected that Norah
      Hood might snatch considerable happiness out of the contract after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything of the old playmate?&rdquo; Mrs. Stellasis asked Dr.
      Ruthine suddenly one afternoon in the Red Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark Ruthine looked into the pleasant face and saw a back to the question&mdash;many
      backs, extending away into a perspective of feminine speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They lapsed into a little silence. And then they both looked up, and saw
      Norah Hood walking slowly backwards and forwards with Manly Fenn of the
      Guides.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it was only natural that these two young persons should drift
      together. They were both so &ldquo;quiet and stupid.&rdquo; Neither had much to say to
      the world, and they both alike heard what the world had to say with that
      somewhat judicial calm which knocks down feeble wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sparkle about either of them, and the world is given to
      preferring bad champagne to good burgundy because of the sparkle. The
      world therefore left Manly Fenn alone; and Manly Fenn, well pleased, went
      about his own business. It has been decreed that men who go about their
      own business very carefully find that it is a larger affair than they at
      first took it to be. Manly Fenn had never been aware until quite lately
      that these things which he took to be his own affairs were in reality the
      business of an Empire. The Empire found it out before Manly Fenn&mdash;found
      it out, indeed, when its faithful servant was hiring himself out as
      assistant-herdsman to a large farmer on the Beloochistan frontier.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Major Fenn had to buy a new uniform, had to interview many high-placed
      persons, and had, finally, to present himself before his Gracious
      Sovereign, who hooked a little cross into the padding of his tunic&mdash;all
      of which matters were extremely disagreeable to Manly Fenn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the devil&mdash;as the captain bluffly affirmed&mdash;brought it
      to pass that he, Manly Fenn, should take passage in the Mahanaddy on the
      voyage of which we have to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very sudden, and many thorough things are so. It happened somewhere
      in the Red Sea, and Mrs. Stellasis was probably the first to sniff danger
      in the breeze. That was why she asked Mark Ruthine if he knew anything
      about the old playmate to whom Norah Hood was engaged. That was why Mark
      Ruthine looked for the back of the question; for he was almost as expert
      as a woman among the humanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere between Ismailia and the Gate of Tears, Love came on board the
      Mahanaddy&mdash;a sorry pilot&mdash;and took charge of Manly Fenn and the
      girl who was going out to marry her old playmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a serious matter from the first&mdash;like a fever that takes a man
      of middle age who has never been ill before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a consultation of the authorities&mdash;Mrs Stellasis, namely,
      and the captain, and Mark Ruthine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain disgraced himself early in the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is only a flirtation,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mrs. Stellasis laughed scornfully, and the mariner collapsed.
      Moreover, the consultation resulted in nothing, although Stellasis himself
      joined it, looking grave and thoughtful behind his great grey moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Known Manly Fenn for ten years,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I am afraid of him still.
      I cannot speak to him. Can you not say something to the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Stellasis shook her head with determination. That was the worst
      of it&mdash;they were not the sort of persons to whom one can say such
      things. The captain was technically responsible, but he had proved himself
      utterly incompetent. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Stellasis finally. There was nothing
      to be done but hope for the best. Of course, Mrs. Stellasis was without
      conscience&mdash;quite without justice. It is to be feared that nearly all
      women are. She was all for Manly Fenn and dead against the old playmate,
      whom she intuitively described as &ldquo;that stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time all the ship knew it. In some ways the two culprits were
      singularly innocent. It is possible that they did not know that the world
      is never content unless it is elbow-deep in its neighbour's pie&mdash;that
      their affairs were the talk of the Mahanaddy. It is also possible that
      they knew and did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good steamer pounded out of the Gate of Tears and struck a bee-line
      across the Arabian Sea. The passengers settled down to await the sequel
      which would be delivered to them at Madras.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norah Hood and Fenn were together from morning till night. They seemed to
      ignore the sequel, which made it all the more exciting for the lookers-on.
      Norah still saw a good deal of Mrs. Stellasis. She still took a great
      interest in the &ldquo;specimen,&rdquo; whose small ailments received her careful
      attention. With Mark Ruthine she was almost familiar, in her quiet way.
      She came to his little surgery to get such minute potions as the
      &ldquo;specimen&rdquo; might require. She even got to know the bottles, and mixed the
      drugs herself while he laughingly watched her. She had dispensed for a
      village population at home, and knew a little medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruthine encouraged her to come, gave her the freedom of his medicine
      chests, and all the while he watched her. She interested him. There were
      so many things which he could not reconcile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some ways she was quite a different woman. This love which had come to
      her suddenly&mdash;rather late in her life&mdash;had made a strange being
      of her. She was still gentle, and rather prim and quite self-possessed.
      She looked Ruthine in the face, and knew that he knew all about her; but
      she was not in the least discomposed. She was astonishingly daring. She
      defied him and the whole world&mdash;gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Dutch lighthouse at Galle was duly sighted, and the Mahanaddy
      was in the Bay of Bengal. The last dinner was duly consumed, and the usual
      speech made by the usual self-assertive old civilian. And, for the last
      time, the Mahanaddy passengers said good night to each other, seeking
      their cabins with a pleasant sense of anticipation. The next day would
      bring the sequel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stewardess awoke Mark Ruthine up before it was light. He followed the
      woman to number seventy-seven cabin. There he found Norah Hood, dressed,
      lying quietly on her berth&mdash;dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle&mdash;one of his bottles from the medicine-chest&mdash;stood on
      the table beside her.

      A PARIAH

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I have heard that there is corn in Egypt.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Slyne's Chare is in South Shields, and Mason's Chop House stands at the
      lower corner of Slyne's Chare&mdash;Mason's Chop House, where generations
      of honest Tyneside sailors have consumed pounds of honest mutton and beef,
      and onions therewith. For your true salt loves an onion ashore, which
      makes him a pleasanter companion at sea. Mason's Chop House is a
      low-roofed, red-tiled, tarred cottage with a balcony&mdash;a &ldquo;balcohny&rdquo;
       overhanging the river. It is quite evident that the &ldquo;balcohny&rdquo; was
      originally built, and has subsequently been kept in repair, by ships'
      carpenters. It is so glaringly ship-shape, so redolent of tar, so
      ridiculously strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keen fresh breeze&mdash;and there is nothing keener, fresher,
      stronger, and wholesomer in the world than that which comes roaring up
      between the two piers of the Tyne&mdash;this breeze blows right through
      Mason's, and blows the fume of cooking out into Slyne's Chare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evening&mdash;tea-time&mdash;and the day's work is almost done; for
      Mason's does little in suppers. A bullet-headed boy is rubbing pewter pots
      at the door. Mrs. Mason, comfortably somnolent at the entrance of the
      little kitchen, watches her daughter&mdash;comely, grave-faced Annie Mason&mdash;&ldquo;our
      Annie,&rdquo; as she is called, who is already folding the table-cloths. A few
      belated customers linger in the partitioned loose-boxes which lend a
      certain small privacy to the tables, and often save a fight. They are
      talking in gruff, North-country voices, which are never harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man comes in, after a moment's awkward pause at the open door, and seeks
      a secluded seat where the gas overhead hardly affords illumination. He is
      a broad-built man&mdash;a Tynesider; not so very big for South Shields; a
      matter of six feet one, perhaps. He carries a blue spotted handkerchief
      against his left cheek, and the boy with the pewter pots stares eagerly at
      the other. A boy of poor tact this; for the customer's right cheek is
      horribly disfigured. It is all bruised and battered in from the curve of a
      square jaw to the cheek-bone, which is broken. But the eye is intact; a
      shrewd, keen eye, accustomed to the penetration of a Northern mist&mdash;accustomed
      to a close scrutiny of men's faces. It is painfully obvious that this
      sailor&mdash;for gait and clothes and manner set aside all other crafts&mdash;is
      horribly conscious of his deformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got the toothache?&rdquo; inquires the tactless youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer replies in the negative and orders a cup of tea and a
      herring. It is Annie who brings the simple meal and sets it down without
      looking at the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he growls in his brown beard, and the woman pauses suddenly. She
      listens, as if hearing some distant sound. Then she slowly turns&mdash;for
      she has gone a step or two from the table&mdash;and makes a pretence of
      setting the salt and pepper closer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three ships had come up with the afternoon tide&mdash;a coaster, a
      Norwegian barque in ballast, and a full-rigged ship with nitrate from the
      West Coast of South America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just ashore?&rdquo; inquired Annie&mdash;economical with her words, as they
      mostly are round the Northern river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the West Coast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; grumbles the man. He holds the handkerchief to his cheek, and turns
      the herring tentatively with a fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find it's a good enough fish,&rdquo; says the woman, bluntly. Her two
      hands are pressed to her comely bosom in a singular way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; says the man again, as if he had no other word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock strikes six, and the boy, more mindful of his own tea than his
      neighbour's ailments, slips on his jacket and goes home. The last
      customers dawdle out with a grunt intended for a salutation. Mrs. Mason is
      softly heard to snore. And all the while Annie Mason&mdash;all the colour
      vanished from her wholesome face&mdash;stands with her hands clutching her
      dress, gazing down at the man, who still examines the herring with a
      self-conscious awkwardness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geordie!&rdquo; she says. They are all called Geordie in South Shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lass!&rdquo; he answers, shamefacedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie Mason sits down suddenly&mdash;opposite to him. He does not look up
      but remains, his face half hidden by the spotted blue handkerchief, a
      picture of self-conscious guilt and shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did ye did it for, Geordie?&rdquo; she asks, breathlessly. &ldquo;Eleven years,
      come March&mdash;oh, it was cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I do it for?&rdquo; he repeats. &ldquo;What did I do it for? Why, lass,
      can't ye see my face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drops the handkerchief, and holds up his poor scarred countenance. He
      does not look at her, but away past her with the pathetic shame of a
      maimed dog. The cheek thus suddenly exposed to view is whole and brown and
      healthy. Beneath the mahogany-coloured skin there is a glow singularly
      suggestive of a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I see your face,&rdquo; she answers, with a note of tenderness for the poor
      scarred cheek. &ldquo;I hope you haven't been at the drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shakes his head with a little sad smile that twists up his one-sided
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because you wanted to get shot of me?&rdquo; asks the woman, with a sort
      of breathlessness. She has large grey-blue eyes with a look of constant
      waiting in them&mdash;a habit of looking up at the open door at the sound
      of every footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;n it, Annie. Could I come back to you with a face like this; and
      you the prettiest lass on the Tyneside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is fumbling with her apron string. There is a half-coquettish bend of
      her head&mdash;with the grey hairs already at the temple&mdash;awakened
      perhaps by some far-off echo in his passionate voice. She looks up slowly,
      and does not answer his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; she says slowly. &ldquo;Tell us where ye've been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been?&mdash;oh, I don't know, lass! I don't rightly remember. Not that it
      matters. Up the West Coast, trading backwards and forwards. I've got my
      master's certificate now. Serving first mate on board the Mallard to
      Falmouth for orders, and they ordered us to the Tyne. I brought her round&mdash;I
      knew the way. I thought you'd be married, lass. But maybe ye are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I'm daft,&rdquo; puts in Annie coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I greatly feared,&rdquo; the man goes on with the slow self-consciousness of
      one unaccustomed to talk of himself. &ldquo;I greatly feared I'd meet up with a
      bairn of yours playing in the doorway. Losh! I could not have stood THAT!
      But that's why I stayed away, Annie, lass! So that you might marry a man
      with a face on him. I thought you would not know me if I held up my
      handkerchief over my other cheek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is a strange gleam in the woman's eyes&mdash;a gleam that one or two
      of the old masters have succeeded in catching and imparting to the face of
      their Madonnas, but only one or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by your hurt?&rdquo; she asks in her low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Board the old Walleroo going out. You mind the old ship? We had a fire in
      the hold, and the skipper he would go down alone to locate it before we
      cut a hole in the deck and shipped the hose in. The old man did not come
      up again. Ye mind him. Old Rutherford of Jarrow. And I went down and
      looked for him. It was a hell of smoke and fire, and something in the
      cargo stinking like&mdash;like hell fire as it burnt. I got a hold of the
      old man, and was fetching him out on my hands and knees, when something
      busts up and sends us all through the deck. I had three months in
      Valparaiso hospital; but I saved old Jack Rutherford of Jarrow. And when I
      got up and looked at my face I saw that it was not in the nature of things
      that I could ever ask a lass to have me. So I just stayed away and made
      believe that&mdash;that I had changed my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man pauses. He is not glib of speech, though quick enough at sea. As
      he takes up the little teapot and shakes it roundwise, after the manner of
      the galley, his great brown hand shakes too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have come back here,&rdquo; he goes on after a silence; &ldquo;but the
      Mallard was ordered to the Tyne. And a chap must do his duty by his
      shipmates and his owners. And I thought it would be safe&mdash;after
      eleven years. When I saw the old place and smelt the smell of the old
      woman's frying-pan, I could not get past the door. But I hung around,
      looking to make sure there were no bairns playing on the floor. I have
      only come in, lass, to pass the time of day and to tell you ye're a free
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He is not looking at her. He seems to find that difficult. So he does not
      see the queer little smile&mdash;rather sadder, in itself, than tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you stayed away eleven years&mdash;because o' THAT?&rdquo; says the woman,
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, you know, lass, I'm no great hand at the preaching and Bibles and the
      like; but it seems pretty clear that them who's working things did not
      think it fit that we should marry. And so it was sent. I got to think it
      so in time&mdash;least, I think it's that sometimes. And no woman would
      like to say, 'That's my man&mdash;him with only half a face.' So I just
      stayed away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All for that?&rdquo; asks the woman, her face, which is still, pretty and round
      and rosy, working convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, honey,&rdquo; she cries softly, &ldquo;you dinna understand us women!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE PRODIGAL'S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, he will come. Of course he will come!&rdquo; And the girl turned
      her drawn and anxious young face towards the cottage door, just as if her
      blind mother could see the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is probable that the old woman divined the longing glance from the
      change in the girl's tone, for she, too, half turned towards the door. It
      was a habit these two women had acquired. They constantly looked towards
      the door for the arrival of one who never came through the long summer
      days, through the quiet winter evenings; moreover, they rarely spoke of
      other things, this arrival was the topic of their lives. And now the old
      woman's life was drawing to a close, as some lives do, without its object.
      She herself felt it, and her daughter knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in both of them a subtle sense of clinging. It was hard to die
      without touching the reward of a wondrous patience. It was cruel to
      deprive the girl of this burden, for in most burdens there is a safeguard,
      in all a duty, and in some the greatest happiness allotted to human
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no new thing, this waiting for the scapegrace son; the girl had
      grown up to it, for she would not know her brother should she meet him in
      the street. Since sight had left the old mother's eyes, she had fed her
      heart upon this hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left them eighteen years before in a fit of passionate resentment
      against his father, whose only fault had been too great an indulgence for
      the son of his old age. Nothing had been too good for dear Stephen&mdash;hardly
      anything had been good enough. Educated at a charity school himself, the
      simple old clergyman held the mistaken view that no man can be educated
      above his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some people who hold this view still, but they cannot do so much
      longer. Strikes, labour troubles, and the difficulties of domestic
      service, so called gentleman farmers, gentleman shopkeepers and lady
      milliners&mdash;above all, a few colonies peopled by University failures,
      will teach us in time that to educate our sons above their station is to
      handicap them cruelly in the race of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Leach was one of the early victims to this craze. His father,
      having risen by the force of his own will and the capabilities of his own
      mind from the People to the Church, held, as such men do, that he had only
      to give his son a good education to ensure his career in life. So
      everything&mdash;even to the old parson's sense of right and wrong&mdash;was
      sacrificed to the education of Stephen Leach at public school and
      University. Here he met and selected for his friends youths whose futures
      were ensured, and who were only passing through the formula of an
      education so that no one could say they were unfit for the snug Government
      appointment, living, or inheritance of a more substantial sort, that might
      be waiting for them. Stephen acquired their ways of life without
      possessing their advantages, and the consequence was something very nearly
      approaching to ruin for the little country rectory. Not having been a
      University man himself, the rector did not know that at Oxford or
      Cambridge, as in the army, one may live according to one's taste. Stephen
      Leach had expensive tastes, and he unscrupulously traded on his father's
      ignorance. He was good-looking, and had a certain brilliancy of manner
      which &ldquo;goes down&rdquo; well at the 'Varsity. Everything was against him, and at
      last the end came. At last the rector's eyes were opened, and when a
      narrow-minded man's eyes are once opened he usually becomes stony at
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Leach left England, and before he landed in America his father had
      departed on a longer journey. The ne'er-do-well had the good grace to send
      back the little sums of money saved by his mother in her widowhood, and
      gradually his letters ceased. It was known that he was in Chili, and there
      was war going on there, and yet the good old lady's faith never wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come, Joyce,&rdquo; she would say; &ldquo;he will surely come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And somehow it came to be an understood thing that he was to come in the
      afternoon when they were all ready for him&mdash;when Joyce had clad her
      pretty young form in a dark dress, and when the old lady was up and seated
      in her chair by the fire in winter, by the door in summer. They had never
      imagined his arrival at another time. It would not be quite the same
      should he make a mistake and come in the morning, before Joyce had got the
      house put right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, he never came. A greater infirmity came instead, and at last Joyce
      suggested that her mother should not get up in bad weather. They both knew
      what this meant, but the episode passed as others do, and Mrs. Leach was
      bedridden. Still she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will come, Joyce! He will surely come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the girl would go to the window and draw aside the curtain, looking
      down the quiet country road towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, he will come!&rdquo; was her usual answer; and one day she gave a
      little exclamation of surprise and almost of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;there is some one coming along the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady was already sitting up in bed, staring with her sightless
      orbs towards the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they waited. The man stopped opposite the cottage, and the two women
      heard the latch of the gate. Then Joyce, turning, saw that her mother had
      fainted. But it was only momentary. By the time she reached the bed her
      mother had recovered consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said the old lady, breathlessly; &ldquo;go and let him in yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs, on the doorstep, the girl found a tall man of thirty or
      thereabouts with a browner face than English suns could account for. He
      looked down into her eager eyes with a strange questioning wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I too late?&rdquo; he asked in a voice which almost seemed to indicate a
      hope that it might be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Stephen,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But mother cannot live much longer. You are
      just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man made a hesitating little movement with his right hand and
      shuffled uneasily on the clean stone step. He was like an actor called
      suddenly upon the stage having no knowledge of his part. The return of
      this prodigal was not a dramatic success. No one seemed desirous of
      learning whether he had lived upon husks or otherwise and with whom he had
      eaten. The quiet dignity of the girl, who had remained behind to do all
      the work and bear all the burden seemed in some subtle manner to deprive
      him of any romance that might have attached itself to him. She ignored his
      half-proffered hand, and turning into the little passage, led the way
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Leach followed silently. He was rather large for the house, and
      especially for the stairs; moreover, he had a certain burliness of walk,
      such as is acquired by men living constantly in the open. There was a
      vaguely-pained look in his blue eyes, as if they had suddenly been opened
      to his own shortcomings. His attitude towards Joyce was distinctly
      apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he followed the girl across the threshold of their mother's bedroom
      the old lady was sitting up in bed, holding out trembling arms towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Stephen Leach seemed to know better what to do. He held his mother in
      his arms while she sobbed and murmured out her joy. He had no words, but
      his arms meant more than his lips could ever have told.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that the best part of happiness is the sharing of it with
      some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; was the first distinct word the old lady spoke, &ldquo;Joyce, he has
      come at last. He has come! Come here, dear. Kiss your brother. This is my
      firstborn&mdash;my little Steve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man had sunk upon his knees at the bedside, probably because it
      was the most convenient position. He did not second his mother's proposal
      with much enthusiasm. Altogether he did not seem to have discovered much
      sympathy with the sister whom he had left in her cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce came forward and leaned over the bed to kiss her brother while the
      old lady's hands joined theirs. Just as her fresh young lips came within
      reach he turned his face aside, so that the kiss fell on barren ground on
      his tanned cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joyce,&rdquo; continued the old lady, feverishly, &ldquo;I am not afraid to die now,
      for Stephen is here. Your brother will take care of you, dear, when I am
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was strange that Stephen had not spoken yet; and it was perhaps just as
      well, because there are occasions in life when men do wisely to keep
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is strong,&rdquo; the proud mother went on. &ldquo;I can feel it. His hands are
      large and steady and quiet, and his arms are big and very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man knelt upright and submitted gravely to this maternal
      inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I knew he would grow to be a big man. His little fingers
      were so strong&mdash;he hurt me sometimes. What a great moustache! I knew
      you had been a soldier. And the skin of your face is brown and a little
      rough. What is this? what is this, Stephen dear? Is this a wound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Prodigal, speaking for the first time. &ldquo;That is a
      sword cut. I got that in the last war. I am a colonel in the Chilian army,
      or was, before I resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady's sightless eyes were fixed on his face, as if listening for
      the echo of another voice in his deep quiet tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your voice is deeper than your father's ever was,&rdquo; she said; and all the
      while her trembling fingers moved lovingly over his face, touching the
      deep cut from cheek-bone to jaw with soft inquiry. &ldquo;This must have been
      very near your eye, Stephen. Promise me, dear, no more soldiering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise that,&rdquo; he replied, without raising his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the home-coming of the Prodigal. After all, he arrived at the
      right moment in the afternoon, when the house was ready. It sometimes does
      happen so in real life, and not only in books. There is a great deal that
      might be altered in this world, but sometimes, by a mere chance, things
      come about rightly. And yet there was something wrong, something subtle,
      which the dying woman's duller senses failed to detect. Her son, her
      Stephen, was quiet, and had not much to say for himself. He apparently had
      the habit of taking things as they came. There was no enthusiasm, but
      rather a restraint in his manner, more especially towards Joyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl noticed it, but even her small experience of human kind had
      taught her that large, fair-skinned men are often thus. They are not &ldquo;de
      ceux qui s'expliquent,&rdquo; but go through life placidly, leaving unsaid and
      undone many things which some think they ought to say and do.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first excitement of the return was over it became glaringly
      apparent that Stephen had arrived just in time. His mother fell into a
      happy sleep before sunset; and when the active young doctor came a little
      later in the evening he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I see that she is asleep and quiet&mdash;too quiet. It is
      a foretaste of a longer sleep; some old people have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Joyce's courage seemed to give way. When she had been
      alone she was brave enough, but now that her brother was there,
      woman-like, she seemed to turn to him with a sudden fear. They stood side
      by side near the bed; and the young doctor involuntarily watched them.
      Stephen had taken her hand in his with that silent sympathy which was so
      natural and so eloquent. He said nothing, this big, sun-tanned youth; he
      did not even glance down at his sister, who stood small, soft-eyed, and
      gentle at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor knew something of the history of the small family thus
      momentarily united, and he had always feared that if Stephen Leach did
      return it would only kill his mother. This, indeed, seemed to be the
      result about to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the doctor took his leave. He was a young man engaged in getting
      together a good practice, and in his own interest he had been forced to
      give up waiting for his patients to finish dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are here,&rdquo; he said to Stephen, who accompanied him to the
      door. &ldquo;It would not do for your sister to be alone; this may go on for a
      couple of days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not go on for a couple of days, but Mrs. Leach lived through that
      night in the same semi-comatose state. The two watchers sat in her room
      until supper-time, when they left their mother in charge of a hired nurse,
      whose services Joyce had been forced to seek.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Stephen Leach seemed at last to find his tongue, and he
      talked in his quiet, almost gentle voice, such as some big men possess,
      not about himself or the past, but about Joyce and the future. In a
      deliberate business-like way, he proceeded to investigate the affairs of
      the dying woman and the prospects of her daughter; in a word, he asserted
      his authority as a brother, and Joyce was relieved and happy to obey him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not in times of gaiety that friendships are formed, but in sorrow or
      suspense. During that long evening this brother and sister suddenly became
      intimate, more so than months of prosperous intercourse could have made
      them. At ten o'clock Stephen quietly insisted that Joyce should go to bed
      while he lay down, all dressed, on the sofa in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sleep perfectly; it is not the first time I have slept in my
      clothes,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went upstairs together and told the nurse of this arrangement. Joyce
      remained for some moments by the bedside watching her mother's peaceful
      sleep, and when she turned she found that Stephen had quietly slipped
      away. Wondering vaguely whether he had intentionally solved her difficulty
      as to the fraternal good-night, she went to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mrs. Leach was fully conscious, and appeared to be
      stronger; nevertheless, she knew that the end was near. She called her two
      children to her bedside, and, turning her blind eyes towards them, spoke
      in broken sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready now&mdash;I am ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dears, I am going to your
      father&mdash;and... thank God, I can tell him that I have left you
      together. I always knew Stephen would come back. I found it written
      everywhere in the Bible. Stephen&mdash;kiss me, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man leant over the bed and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;how I wish I could see you&mdash;just once before I
      die. Joyce!&rdquo; she added, suddenly turning to her daughter, who stood at the
      other side of the bed, &ldquo;tell me what he is like. But&mdash;I know .. I
      KNOW&mdash;I feel it. Listen! He is tall and spare, like his father. His
      hair is black, like&mdash;like his father's&mdash;it was black before he
      went away. His eyes, I know, are dark&mdash;almost black. He is pale&mdash;like
      a Spaniard!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Joyce, looking across the bed with slow horror dawning in her face, looked
      into a pair of blue eyes beneath tawny hair, cut short as a soldier's hair
      should be. She looked upon a man big, broad, fair&mdash;English from crown
      to toe&mdash;and the quiet command of his lips and eyes made her say&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some moments there was silence. Joyce stood pale and breathless,
      wondering what this might mean. Then the dying woman spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I... am going. Stephen first&mdash;my firstborn! And
      now, Joyce... and now kiss each other&mdash;across the bed! I want to hear
      it... I want... to tell... your... father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a last effort she raised her hands, seeking their heads. At first
      Joyce hesitated, then she leant forward, and the old woman's chilled
      fingers pressed their lips together. That was the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards Joyce and this man stood facing each other in the
      little dining-room. He began his explanation at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was shot&mdash;out there&mdash;as a traitor. I could
      not tell her that! I did not mean to do this, but what else could I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, moved towards the door with that same strange hesitation which
      she had noticed on his arrival. At the door he turned, to justify himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I still think,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that it was the best thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joyce made no answer. The tears stood in her eyes. There was something
      very pathetic in the distress of this strong man, facing, as it were, an
      emergency of which he felt the delicacy to be beyond his cleverness to
      handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I made all the necessary arrangements for your
      future just as Stephen would have made them&mdash;as a brother might have
      done. I... he and I were brother officers in a very wild army. Your
      brother&mdash;was not a good man. None of us were.&rdquo; His hand was on the
      door. &ldquo;He asked me to come and tell you,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I shall go back
      now....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood thus: he watching her face with his honest soft blue eyes, she
      failing to meet his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come back again?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little gasp, but made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come back in six months,&rdquo; he announced quietly, and then he closed
      the door behind him.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
